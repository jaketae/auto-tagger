"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","In the later segment of his life, Euler found a way to express the zeta function as, you guessed it, an infinite product. This time, however, Euler did not rely on Taylor polynomials. Instead, he employed a more general approach to the problem. It is here that we witness Euler’s clever manipulation of equations again. We commence from the zeta function, whose terms are enumerated below. Much like how we multiply the ratio to a geometric sequence to calculate its sum, we adopt a similar approach by multiplying the second term,  to the entire expression. This operations yields By subtracting this modified zeta function from the original, we derive the following expression below. Now, we only have what might be considered as the odd terms of the original zeta function. We then essentially repeat the operation we have performed so far, by multiplying the expression by  and subtracting the result from the odd-term zeta function. It is not difficult to see that iterating through this process will eventually yield Euler’s product identity for the zeta function. The key to understanding this identity is that only prime numbers will appear as a component of the product identity. We can see this by reminding ourselves of the clockwork behind the sieve of Eratosthenes, which is basically how the elimination and factorization works in the derivation of Euler’s identity. Taking this into account, we can deduce that Euler’s identity will take the following form: This expression is Euler’s infinite product representation of the zeta function.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Dissecting LSTMs,"The first component of LSTM is the forget gate. This corresponds to these two set of equations: (1) is nothing more than just the good old forward pass. We concatenate  and , then multiply it with some weights, add a bias, and apply a sigmoid activation. At this point, you might be wondering why we use a sigmoid activation instead of something like ReLU. The reason behind this choice of activation function becomes apparent once we look at (4), which is how LSTM imitates forgetting. For now, we will only focus on the first term in (4). Recall that the output of a sigmoid activation is between 0 and 1. Say the output of applying a sigmoid activation results in some value that is very close to 0. In that case, calculating the Hadamard product will also result in a value of an entry very close to 0. Given the interpretation that , also known as the cell state, is an artificial way of simulating long-term memory, we can see how having zeros is similar to forgetfulness: a zero entry effectively means that the network deemed a particular piece of information as obsolete and decided to forget it in favor of accepting new information. In short, the sigmoid activation and the Hadamard product form the basis of LSTM’s forget gate. By now, it should be apparent why we use sigmoid activations: instead of causing divergence with something like ReLU, we want to deliberately saturate and cause the network to produce some “vanishing” values.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
GAN in PyTorch,"In this blog post, we will be revisiting GANs, or general adversarial networks. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen GANs on this blog: we’ve implemented GANs in Keras, and we have also looked at the mathematics behind GANs. Well, this is somewhat of a repeat of what we’ve done, since all we’re doing here is reimplementing GANs using PyTorch, but I still think it’s worth a revisit. As always, we start by importing the necessary modules in PyTorch, as well as other libraries. Although we’ll be using CPU instead of GPUs, it’s always good to have a  object set up so that we can utilize GPUs should we run this script or notebook in a different environment. We’re not going to do anything too fancy (and I learned from experience that vanilla GANs are incredibly hard to train and can produce artifact-ridden results). Let’s keep in simple this time and try to implement a GAN that generates MNIST images. Below are the configurations we will use for our GAN. We can define a simple transformation that converts images to tensors, then applies a standard normalization procedure for easier training. Next, we create a dataset object and a data loader that batches and shuffles post-transformation images for us. You might recall that GANs are composed of two different networks: a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator, also metaphorically referred to as the police, is a classier that tries to determine whether a given data is real or fake, i.e. produced by the generator network.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the Bayesian way of thinking was eschewed for so long by statisticians: prior to the advent of calculators and computers, mathematicians had trouble deriving the closed-form expression for the evidence term with just pen and paper. We might consider options other than direct calculation, such as Monte Carlo approximation or deriving a proportionality experssion by assuming evidence to be a constant. Indeed, the latter is the approach we took in this post on Bayesian inference. Using a beta prior and binomial likelihood, we used the property of conjugacy to derive a formula for the posterior. However, this raises yet another question: what if the prior and likelihood do not have a conjugate relationship? What if we have a very messy prior or complicated likelihood function, so convoluted to the point that calculating the posterior is near impossible? Simple Monte Carlo approximation might not do because of a problem called the curse of dimensionality: the volume of the sample space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. In high dimensions, the brute force Monte Carlo approach may not be the most appropriate. Markov Chain Monte Carlo seeks to solve this conundrum of posterior derivation in high dimensions sample space. And indeed, it does a pretty good job of solving it. How does Markov Chain Monte Carlo get around the problem outlined above? To see this, we need to understand the two components that comprise Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Markov chains and Monte Carlo methods.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Word2vec from Scratch,"While this is a relatively simple, basic implementation of word2vec, the underlying principle remains the same nonetheless. The idea is that, we can train a neural network to generate word embeddings in the form of a weight matrix. This is why embedding layers can be trained to generate custom embeddings in popular neural network libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you end up training word embeddings on large datasets like Wikipedia, you end up with things like word2vec and GloVe, another extremely popular alternative to word2vec. In general, it’s fascinating to think that, with enough data, we can encode enough semantics into these embedding vectors to see relationships such as “king - man + woman = queen.” I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this post.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"After something like 30 iterations, it seems like algorithm has converged to the minimum, sitting at around 86.25. Apparently, the best way to travel the cities is to go in the order of . But this was more of a contrived example. We want to see if this algorithm can scale. So let’s write some functions to generate city coordinates and corresponding adjacency matrices. generates  number of random city coordinates in the form of a numpy array. Now, we need some functions that will create an adjacency matrix based on the city coordinates. Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see if  works as expected. Here, give vertices of a unit square as input to the function. While we’re at it, let’s also make sure that  indeed does create city coordinates as expected. Now, we’re finally ready to use these functions to randomly generate city coordinates and use the genetic algorithm to find the optimal path using  with the appropriate parameters. Let’s run the algorithm for a few iterations and plot its history.  We can see that the genetic algorithm does seems to be optimizing the path as we expect, since the distance metric seems to be decreasing throughout the iteration. Now, let’s actually try plotting the path along with the corresponding city coordinates. Here’s a helper function to print the optimal path. And calling this function, we obtain the following:  At a glance, it’s really difficult to see if this is indeed the optimal path, especially because the city coordinates were generated at random.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"This is why deep learning is such a powerful tool: it can be trained to detect nonlinear, complex patterns in data that a human might otherwise be unable to identify. Our vanilla neural network will make use of two activation functions: softmax and ReLU. If you have read my previous post on the Keras functional API, you might recall that we used softmax and ReLU for certain dense layers. Back then, we considered them to be a blackbox without necessarily taking a look at what they do. Let’s explore the details and get our hands dirty today. Mathematically speaking, the softmax function is a function that takes a vector as input and outputs a vector of equal length. Concretely, where Although the formula may appear complex, the softmax function is a lot simpler than it seems. First, note that all  entries of the returned vector  add up to 1. From here, it is possible to see that the softmax function is useful for ascribing the probability that a sample belongs to one of  classes: the -th element of  would indicate the probability of the sample belonging to the -th class. Put another way, the index of the largest entry in  is the class label number that is most probable. Implementing the softmax function is extremely easy thanks to the vectorized computation made possible through . Presented below is one possible implementation of the softmax function in Python. This particular implementation, however, poses two problems. First, it is susceptible to arithematic overflow.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"This is the motivation behind the notion of a natural gradient. Now you might be wondering how all this has anything to do with the Fisher matrix, which we looked at in the previous post. Well, it turns out there are some deep, interesting questions to be posed and connections to be uncovered. If we’re going to search around the distribution space, one natural question to consider is what distance metric we will use for our search. In case of batch gradient descent, we used Euclidean distance. This made sense since we were simply measuring the distance between two parameters, which are effectively scalars or vector quantities. If we want to search the distribution space, on the other hand, we would have to measure the distance between two probability distributions, one that is defined by the previous parameter and the other defined by the newly found parameter after natural gradient descent. Well, we know one great candidate for this task right off the bat, and that is KL divergence. Recall that KL divergence is a way of quantifying the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. The formula for KL divergence is shown below. And while we’re at it, let’s throw cross entropy and entropy into the picture as well, both for review and clarity’s sake: For a short, simple review of these concepts, refer to this previous article, or Aurelien Geron’s video on YouTube. In most cases,  is the true distribution which we seek to model, while  is some more tractable distribution at our disposal.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"How do we find this distribution? Well, we know one handy concept that measures the difference or the pseudo-distance between two distributions, and that is Kullback-Leibler divergence. As we discussed in this post on entropy, KL divergence tells us how different two distributions are. So the goal here would be find a distribution that minimizes the following expression: Using the definition of conditional probability, we can simplify (4) as follows: The trick is to notice that  is a constant that can break out of the expectation calculation. Let’s continue by deriving an expression for the evidence term. A useful property to know about KL divergence is the fact that it is always non-negative. We will get into why this is the case in a moment. For now, let’s assume non-negativity to be true and transform (6) into an inequality: The term on the right of the inequality is known as the Evidence Lower Bound, or ELBO for short. Why are we interested in ELBO? First, note that , the evidence, is a constant. Therefore, minimizing KL divergence amounts to maximizing ELBO. This is the key to variational inference: instead of calculating the intractable integral in (3), we can find a distribution  that which minimizes KL divergence by maximizing ELBO, which is a tractable operation. Let’s prove why KL divergence is always greater or equal to zero, which is a condition we assumed to be true in the derivation of ELBO above. For the sake of completeness, I present two ways of proving the same property.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see if the function works as expected. Specifying  to 60 means that each instance in the training data will be 60 consecutive characters sampled from the text data every  characters. The result tells us that we have a total of 200278 training instances, which is probably plenty to train, test, and validate our model. The result also tells us that there are 57 unique characters in the text data. Note that these unique characters not only include alphabets but also and other miscellaneous white spacing characters and punctuations. Let’s now design our model. Because there is obviously going to be sequential, temporal structure underlying the training data, we will use an LSTM layer, a type of advanced recurrent neural network we saw in the previous post. In fact, this is all we need, unless we want to create a deep neural network spanning multiple layers. However, training such a model would cost a lot of time and computational resource. For the sake of simplicity, we will build a simple model with a single LSTM layer. The output layer is going to be a dense layer with  number of neurons, activated with a softmax function. We can thus interpret the index of the biggest value of the final array to correspond to the most likely character.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"From a statistics point of view, all we have to do now is conduct a random survey of the population to see the percentage of the demographic infected with the flu. Let’s say that 15 percent of the population has been affected with this flu. Plugging in the relevant value yields Using Bayes’ theorem, we are able to conclude that there is roughly a 24 percent chance that the man who tests positive on this examination is affected by the flu. That seems pretty low given the 90 percent accuracy of the test, doesn’t it? This ostensible discrepancy originates from the fact that the test has a substantial false positive of 50 percent, and also that the vast majority of the population is unaffected by the disease. This means that, if the entire population were to conduct this test, there would be more false positives than there would be true positives; hence the distortion in the value of the conditional probability. But what if the man were to take the same test again? Intuition tells us that the more test he takes, the more confident we can be on whether the man is or is not affected by the disease. For instance, if the man repeats the exam once and receives a positive report, the conditional probability that he is sick given two consecutive positive test results should be higher than the 24 percent we calculated above.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"I therefore decided to create a much more contrived example, but with many coordinates, so that we can easily verify whether the path decided on by the algorithm is indeed the optimal path. Namely, we will be arranging city coordinates to lie on a semi-circle, using the very familiar equation Let’s create 100 such fake cities and run the genetic algorithm to optimize the path. If the algorithm does successfully find an optimal path, it will be a single curve from one end of the semi-circle fully connected all the way up to its other end.  The algorithm seems to have converged, but the returned  does not seem to be the optimal path, as it is not a sorted array from 0 to 99 as we expect. Plotting this result, the fact that the algorithm hasn’t quite found the most optimal solution becomes clearer. This point notwithstanding, it is still worth noting that the algorithm has found what might be referred to as optimal segments: notice that there are some segments of the path that contain consecutive numbers, which is what we would expect to see in the optimal path.  An optimal path would look as follows.  Comparing the two, we see that the optimal path returned by the genetic algorithm does contain some wasted traveling routes, namely the the chords between certain non-adjacent cities. Nonetheless, a lot of the adjacent cities are connected (hence the use of the aforementioned term, optimal segments).",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","Moreover, the integral term can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function since Applying all the simplifications leave us with Notice that this is a recursive representation of the factorial, since we can further unravel  using the same definition. In other words, So it is now clear that the Gamma function is indeed an interpolation of the factorial function. But the Gamma function deserves a bit more attention and analysis than the simple evaluation we have performed above. Specifically, I want to introduce a few more alternative forms of expressing and deriving the Gamma function. There are many ways to approach this subject, and it would be impossible to exhaust through the entire list of possible representations. For the purposes of this post, we look at two forms of the Gamma function I find intriguing. The first version, presented below, is Euler’s definition of the Gamma function as an infinite product. To see how this comes from, we backtrack this equality by dividing the right-hand side by . At this point, we can reduce the fraction by eliminating  from both the denominator and the numerator, which leaves us with the following expression: Therefore, we have This is another representation of the Gamma function that is distinct from the integral we saw earlier.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Visually, we can imagine the neuron being lit up when the value  is large.  This is similar to how the human brain works, except that biological neurons are binary in that they either fires on or off; artifical neurons in a network typically take a range of values. If we expand the vector operation in (5), it becomes quickly obvious that we can represent an entire layer of neurons as a product of two matrices. Our simple neural network model can thus be expressed as follows: The equations above represent our simple neural network model composed of two affine layers. The output of the first affine layer, , is modified by a ReLU unit. Then, the output is passed onto the second affine layer, , the output of which is passed onto a softmax unit. The output of the softmax function is the final output of our model. Note that ReLU and softmax are denoted as max and sigma, respectively. The code below is a function that intializes our network. Because our  data only has two classes, with each data point containing two entries corresponding to the  and  coordinates of that point, we set both  and  arguments to 2 by default.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"We all know from basic geometry that the value of  approximates to . There are obviously various ways to derive this value. Archimedes famously used hexagons to estimate that the value of  lies between . With later advances in math, mathematicians began to approach this problem from the angle of infinite series or products, the result of which were the Leibniz formula, Wallis product, Euler product, and the likes. And of course, modern computing now allows us to borrow the prowess of machinery to calculate this quantity with extreme accuracy. While the maths behind these derivations are fascinating, our approach will not take these routes; instead, we will use a crude Monte Carlo method. First, we draw a two-by-two square, inside of which we inscribe a circle of radius 1. For convenience purposes, let’s center this circle and square both at the origin. Next, we generate a series of random coordinates within the region of the square. Then, we count the percentage of dots that fall within the area of the cricle. Using a simple formula of proportions, we can calculate the area of the circle, through which we can then estimate the value of . Before we get into the specifics of this algorithm, let’s see hwo this plays out in code. Now that we have the function ready, let’s try calling it with some input parameters.

Anyhow, one of the courses I decided to check out on DataCamp was titled “Introduction to Deep Learning with Python,” which covered basic concepts in deep learning such as forward and backward propagation. The latter half of the tutorial was devoted to the introduction of the Keras API and the implementation of neural networks. I created this notebook immediately after finishing the tutorial for memory retention and self-review purposes. First, we begin by importing the  library as well as other affiliated functions in the module. Note that Keras uses TensorFlow as backend by default. The warning in the code block below appears because this notebook was written on Google Colab, which informs users that the platform will be switching over to TensorFlow 2 in the future. As you might be able to guess from one of the imported modules, the objective of the neural network will be to classify hand-written digits. In doing so, we will be dealing with a classic in machine learning literature known as the the MNIST data set, which contains images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9, each hand-labeled by researchers.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The data we will be looking at is the banknote authentification data set, publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data set contains 1372 observations of bank notes, classified as either authentic or counterfeit. The five features columns of this data set are: Let’s use some modules to import this data set onto our notebook, as shown below. The imported data set was slightly modified in two ways to fit our model. First, I separated the class label data from the data set and stored it as a separate  array. Second, I appended s to each observation to create a new column that accounts for intercept approximation. All this means is that we consider our linear model to be where for all available sample observations. This is something that we have been assuming all along throughout the gradient descent derivation process, but had not been stated explicitly to reduce confusion. Just consider it a strategic choice on our part to simplify the model while allowing for the logistic regression model to consider bias. Let’s check the shape of the imported data set to check that the data has been partitioned correctly. Now, it’s time to split the data into training and testing data.

The Exponential Family,"This was the hard part: now, all that is left is to configure the rest of the functions to complete the factorization. One possible answer is presented below: By now, it should be sufficienty clear that the definition of the exponential family is robust enough to encompass at least the two probability distributions: the exponential and the Bernoulli. Although we do not go over other examples in this article, the exponential family is a well-defined set of probability distributions that, at thei core, are defined by a common structure. And as we will see in the next section, this underlying similarity makes certain calculations surprisingly convenient. In a previous post, we explorerd the notion of maximum likelihood estimation, and contrasted it with maximum a posteriori estimation. The fundamental question that maximum likelihood estimation seems to answer is: given some data, what parameter of a distribution best explains that observation? This is an interesting question that merits exploration in and of itself, but the discussion becomes a lot more interesting and pertinent in the context of the exponential family. Before diving into MLE, let’s define what is known as the canonical form of the exponential family. Despite its grandiose nomenclature, the canonical form simply refers to a specific flavor of factorization scheme where in which case (3) simplifies to We will assume some arbitrary distribution in the exponential family following this canonical form to perform maxmimum likelihood estimation.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Changing the dimensionality of data can be achieved through the  function, which takes in the number of rows and columns as its argument. We convert the numbes into type , then normalize it so that its values are all between 0 and 1. Although we won’t get into too much detail as to why normalization is important, an elementary intuition we might develop is that normalization effectively squishes all values into the same bound, making data much more processable. We also implement one-hot encoding on  through the  function. Let’s quickly check if the necessary adjustments were made by looking up the dimensions of  and , respectively. Looks like the data has been reshaped successfully. Now, it’s finally time to get into the nuts and bolts of a neural network.

Also, working with Django has somewhat helped me grasp the idea of classes more easily, which certainly helped me take in class-based concepts in PyTorch more easily. I distinctively remember people saying that PyTorch is more object-oriented compared to TensorFlow, and I might express agreement to that statement after having gone through the extreme basics of PyTorch. In the upcoming articles, I hope to use PyTorch to build more realistic models, preferrably in the domain of NLP, as that seems to be where PyTorch’s comparative advantage stands out the most compared to TensorFlow. Of course, this is not to say that I don’t like TensorFlow anymore, or that PyTorch is not an appropriate module to use in non-NLP contexts: I think each of them are powerful libraries of their own that provide a unique set of functionalities for the user.

Here’s a suggestion: how about we get rid of the complicated exponential through the substitution Then, it follows that Therefore, the integral in (1) now collapses into Now that looks marginally better. But we have a very dirty constant coefficient at the front. Our natural instinct when we see such a square root expression is to square it. What’s nice about squaring in this case is that the value of the expression is going to stay unchanged at 1.

The Exponential Family,"Although this is by no means a rigorous proof, we see not only the evident fact that the exponential distribution indeed belongs to the exponential family, but also that the factorization formula in (3) isn’t just a complete soup of equations and variables. We can do the same for the Bernoulli distribution, which also falls under the exponential family. The formula for the Bernoulli distribution goes as follows: Again, I have added a very simple indicator function to ensure that the the probability mass function is well-defined across the entire real number line. Again, the indicator function is a simple boolean gate function that checks whether  is an element within a set of zero and one: Factorizing the Bernoulli is slightly more difficult than doing the same for the exponential distribution, largely because it is not apparent from (9) how factorization can be achieved. For example, we do not see any exponential term embedded in (9) as we did in the case of the exponential distributions. Therefore, a simple one-to-one correspondence cannot be identified. The trick to get around this problem is to introduce a log transformation, then reapplying an exponential. In other words, By applying this manipulation, we can artificially create an exponential term to more easily coerce (9) into the factorization mold.

So we instead adhere to the vectorized convention in (3) throughout this post. As I hinted earlier, the exponential family covers a wide range of probability distributions, most PDFs and PMFs. In fact, most probability distributions that force themselves onto the page of statistics textbooks belong to this powerful family. Below is a non-comprehensive list of distributions that belong to the exponential family.

Modeling in PyTorch is the probably the part I love the most. TensorFlow’s sequential API is a great way to start, and PyTorch also provides the same sort of way of building sequential models. However, once you try to build anything that’s more complicated than that, I think PyTorch’s class-based way of approaching modeling makes a lot more intuitive sense and provides more room for experimentation and customization. Before getting into too much detail, below is a very simple CNN we will refer to as an example throughout this post. The first thing you will realize is that the model itself is a class that inherits from . This is a pattern you will see all the time with PyTorch models.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"An impotant observation to make is that, as we have noted earlier, User 6 and User 8 have rows that are identical. While this should not be a surprise given that the two users had what seemed to be an identical taste in movies, it is still interesting to see how SVD is able to extract this information and display it onto a new axis. Next, let’s see what  looks like. Shown above is the transpose of , which means that  is just really . What’s important here is that the five movies have also been reduced to three dimensions. We don’t really know what the columns of this matrix means; all we know is that it is some distillation and amalgamation of information about the ten users on some unknown axis. At any rate, the previous ten dimensional vectors have now been reduced to three dimensions, which is great news for us—as three dimensional beings, it’s always easier to visualize and deal with three dimensions or less than 10D. Movie 2 and Movie 3 do not look as similar as they did before on the ratings matrix. However, perhaps this is due to the fact that all entries of this matrix have pretty small values, and it is difficult to see how the difference between Movie 2 and 3 compares to, say, the distance between Movies 1 and 4.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"First, let’s begin slow and easy by deriving the expressions for the derivative of the sigmoid and the  functions. First, below is the derivative of the sigmoid with respect to , the input. Recall that the sigmoid function is defined as . Let’s do the same for . One useful fact about  is the fact that it is in fact nothing more than just a rescaled sigmoid. This relationship becomes a bit more apparent when we graph the two functions side by side.  Let’s refer to the definition of  to derive an expression for its derivative (no pun intended). Now comes the more complicated part. Thankfully, we’ve already done something very similar in the past when we were building a vanilla neural network from scratch. For instance, we know from this post that, given a cross entropy loss function, the gradient of the softmax layer can simply be calculated by subtracting the predicted probability from the true distribution. In other words, given an intermediate variable we know that Note that  is denoted as  in the code segment. Since we have this information, now it’s just a matter of back propagating the gradients to the lower segments of the acyclic graph that defines the neural network.

"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","This statement might sometimes be phrased differently along the lines of convexity, but this topic is better tabled for a separate future post. The key point here is that setting the gradient to zero would tell us when the error is minimized. This is equivalent to Therefore, Now we are done! Just like in the previous section,  gives us the parameters for our line of best fit, which is the solution to the linear regression problem. In fact, the keen reader might have already noted that (7) is letter-by-letter identical to formula (2) we derived in the previous section using plain old linear algebra! One the one hand, it just seems surprising and fascinating to see how we end up in the same place despite having taken two disparate approaches to the linear regression problem. But on the other hand, this is what we should have expected all along: no matter what method we use, the underlying thought process behind both modes of approach remain the same. Whether it be through projection or through derivation, we sought to find some parameters, closest to the values we are approximating as much as possible, that would turn an otherwise degenerate system into one that is solvable. Linear regression is a simple model, but I hope this post have done it justice by demonstrating the wealth of mathematical insight that can be gleaned from its derivation.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Then, cross entropy would have been calculated as Indeed, we can use our function to verify the coherency of this statement. In other words, when our predicted distribution equals the true distribution we are trying to model, cross entropy becomes 0, as a desirable cost function would behave. This is why crosss entropy is often used in classification models where we have a one-hot encoded vector that represents a true distribution, as exemplified by , and a prediction that models this distribution, denoted as  in our example. It is not difficult to see why cross entropy is a useful cost function frequently used in the field of machine learning. Entropy is an interesting concept with which we can quantify randomness in data. This process is no rocket science, but simply a process that involves calculations with probabilities. Although the link may not be immediately apparent, randomness is just another way of expressing probabilities and uncertainty, and it is from this premise that information and entropy take off. Beyond that, however, entropy is now used extensively in the field of machine learning, specifically as a loss function. Although it was not noted explicitly above, cross entropy calculates the same quantity as the logarithmic loss function. Essentially, cross entropy is useful in that it provides us with some intuitive information of how far two distributions are apart.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Bayesian Linear Regression,"Whereas vanilla linear regression only gives us a single point estimate given an input vector, Bayesian linear regression gives an entire distribution. For the purposes of our demonstration, we will define the predictive posterior to take the following form as shown below, with precision  pre-given. Precision is simply the reciprocal of variance and is commonly used as an alternative way of parametrizing Gaussian distributions. In other words, we assume the model Our goal will be to derive a posterior for this distribution by performing Bayesian inference on , which corresponds to the slope of the linear regression equation, where  denotes noise and randomness in the data, thus affecting our final prediction. To begin Bayesian inference on parameter , we need to specify a prior. Our uninformed prior will look as follows. where  denotes precision, the inverse of variance. Note that we have a diagonal covariance matrix in place of variance, the distribution for  will be a multivariate Gaussian. The next ingredient we need for our recipe is the likelihood function. Recall that likelihood can intuitively be understood as an estimation of how likely it is to observe the given data points provided some parameter for the true distribution of these samples. The likelihood can easily be computed by referencing back to equation (1) above. Note that the dot product of  with itself yields the sum of the exponents, which is precisely the quantity we need when computing the likelihood.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"We don’t have to worry about the dimensionality of the bias since  supports broadcasting by default. Presented below is a visualization of our neural network, created using NN-SVG. Instead of cluttering the diagram by attempting to visualize all 64 neurons, I decided to simplify the picture by assuming that we have 16 neurons in each of the affine layers. But with the power of imagination, I’m sure it’s not so much difficult to see how the picture would change with 64 neurons.  Hopefully the visualization gave you a better understanding of what our model looks like. Now that we have a function that creates our model, we are ready to run the model! At this point, our neural network model is only a dictionary that contains matrices of specified sizes, each containing randomly genereated numbers. You might be wondering how a dictionary can be considered a model—after all, a dictionary is merely a data structure, and so is incapable of performing any operations. To make our model to work, therefore, we need a function that performs matrix multiplications and applies activation functions based on the dictionary. The  function is precisely such a function that uses the weights stored in our model to return both the intermediary and final outputs, denoted as  and  respectively.  Note that we apply activation functions, such as  and  when appropriate. This process of deriving an output from an input using a neural network is known as forward propagation.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Then, we one-hot encode the categorical variables since most machine learning models cannot accept non-numerical values as input. The last PCA step might seem extraneous. However, as discussed in this Stack Overflow thread, the judicious combination of one-hot plus PCA can seldom be beat by other encoding schemes. PCA finds the linear overlap, so will naturally tend to group similar features into the same feature. I don’t have enough experience to attest to the veracity of this claim, but mathematically or statistically speaking, this proposition seems valid. The idea is that one-hot encoding all categorical variables may very well lead to an unmanageable number of columns, thus causing one to flounder in the curse of dimensionality. A quick fix, then, is to apply PCA or some other dimensionality reduction technique onto the results of one-hot encoding. Back to the implementation, note that we can look inside the individual components of  by simply treating it as an iterable, much like a list or tuple. For example, Next, we need to do something similar for numerical variables. Only this time, we wouldn’t be one-hot encoding the data; instead, what we want to do is to apply some scaling, such as normalization or standardization.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"We know for a fact that where  and  denote the events that the coin lands on heads and tails, respectively. How might we be able to express information involved in the event that the coin lands on tails? How about heads? There are many ways to approach this problem, but an easy way would be to use binary numbers. For example, we might ascribe meaning to 0 and 1 such that 0 represents heads and 1 represents tails. Of course, there might be other ways to encode information, such as setting 111 to heads and 000 to tails, but obviously this is wasting information. In other words, it is not the most efficient method of encoding. Even under a single digit binary number scheme, we would be able to decode a series of transmitted information without loss. It is not difficult to see, therefore, that all we need to express the result of a fair coin toss is a single digit of binary numbers 0 and 1. Typically, we use bits to denote the number of digits required to express information in binary numbers. In this case, the information involved in  is equal to 1 bit; by symmetry, the same goes for .

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In a previous post on Markov chains, we examined the clockwork behind eigendecomposition, a technique used to decompose non-degenerate square matrices. Singular value decomposition is similar to eigendecomposition in that it is a technique that can be used to factor matrices into distinct components. In fact, in deriving the SVD formula, we will later inevitably run into eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which should remind us of eigendecomposition. However, SVD is distinct from eigendecomposition in that it can be used to factor not only square matrices, but any matrices, whether square or rectangular, degenerate or non-singular. This wide applicability is what makes singular decomposition such a useful method of processing matrices. Now that we have a general idea of what SVD entails, let’s get down into the details. In this section, we take a look at the mathematical clockwork behind the SVD formula. In doing so, we might run into some concepts of linear algebra that requie us to understand some basic the properties of symmetric matrices. The first section is devoted to explaining the formula using these properties; the second section provides explanations and simple proofs for some of the properties that we reference duirng derivation.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The main takeaway here is the the gradient descent method allows us to find the local minimum of any convex function, no matter how multidimensional or complex. This is an incredibly powerful statement, and it is one that lies at the core of many machine learning algorithms. To implement gradient descent with code, we have to figure out what the gradient descent equation is in the case of logistic regression. To do this, we need a bit of calculus work using the chain rule. Recall that our goal is to compute since we want to calculate the slope of the cross entropy function with respect to the weights vector. For notational convenience, let’s denote the gradient as a derivative: The gradient in (7) can be broken down into distinct components via the chain rule: where So the task of calculating the gradient now boils down to finding the derivative for each of the terms shown in (8). Let’s start with the easiet one, the last term, which is the derivative of  with respect to . From (9), we can conclude that The next in line is the derivative of the sigmoid function, which goes as follows: Now we are almost there.

Moments in Statistics,"We have not looked specifically at the exponential distribution in depth previously, but it is a distribution closely related to the , which we derived in this post. Specifically, when parameter  in a Gamma distribution, it is in effect an exponential distribution. Perhaps we will explore these relationships, along with the Erlang distribution, in a future post. For now, all we have to know is the probability density function of the exponential distribution, which is This time, the task is to obtain the third moment of the distribution, i.e. . But the fundamental approach remains identical: we can either use the definition of expected values to calculate the third moment, or compute the MGF and derive it three times. At a glance, the latter seems a lot more complicated. However, it won’t take long for us to see that sometimes, calculating the MGF is sometimes as easy as, if not easier than, taking the expected values approach. Let’s twist up the order and try the MGF method first. We can pull out the lambda and combine the exponential terms to get This is an easy integral. Let’s proceed with the integration and evaluation sequence: Now, all we have to do is to derive the result in (12) three time and plug in .

The  can simply be thought of as a cache where we can store vectors or matrices to be used during backpropagation. In this case, we store the  by calling  method. During the backward pass, we compute the gradient. Here, we need to retrieve the  variable which was stored in the context. This is because the ReLU function takes the following form: Thus, its derivative is During backpropagation, this means that gradients will flow down to the next layer only for those indices whose input elements to te ReLU function were greater than 0. Thus, we need the input vector for reference purposes, and this is done via stashing it in the  variable. We will see how we can incorporate  into the model in the next section. In this example, we’ll take a look at an extremely simple model to gain a better understanding of how everything comes into play in a more practical example.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"The children of one parent will not all have identical genes: due to mutation, which occurs by chance, some will acquire even more superior features that puts them far ahead of their peers. Needless to say, such beneficiaries of positive mutation will survive and leave offspring, carrying onto the next generation. Those who experience adversarial mutation, on the other hand, will not be able to survive. In genetic algorithm engineering, we want to be able to simulate this process over an extended period of time without hard-coding our solution, such that the end result after hundred or thousands of generations will contain the optimal solution.

The intriguing part is that, even in this complex fibonacci madness, the simple rule still holds.

Let’s take a brief conceptual look at how recurrent neural networks work, then implement a toy RNN to see how it compares to other models on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. I heavily borrowed my examples from Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet and the tutorial on text classification available from the official TensorFlow documentation. Recurrent neural networks, as the name implies, refer to neural network models that contain some sort of internal looping structure that simulates a flow of information. A good way to conceptualize this loop is to think of something like  loops, where a certain operation is performed repeatedly for a specified number of cycles. Given these pieces of information, we might ask ourselves two questions. Firstly, what does this looping operation involve? Secondly, what is the purpose of having this loop in the first place? Let’s try to answer both questions in the following subsections. One of the most salient features of a recurrent neural network is that it is capable of emulating some primitive form of memory.

I still have no idea where this spontaneous journey will take me, but hopefully I can make use of it in one way or another. The topic for today’s post is Monte Carlo methods, something that I have been very interested in for a long time, admittedly because of its eye-catching name. Contrary to my original expectation, Monte Carlo is not named after an eponymous mathematician, but a gambling hot spot in Monaco. The logic behind this nomenclature is that the simulation of random outcomes, such as in the context of an unpredictable gambling game, is what Monte Carlo methods are best suited for. To present a more formal definition, Monte Carlo methods refer to a broad category of  algorithms that use repeated random sampling to make estimations of unknown parameters. Basically, MC methods work by cleverly sampling from a distribution to estimate a variable of interest. This versatility is why MC method is such a powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. In today’s post, we will attempt to solve various bite-sized tasks using MC methods. These tasks will be of varying difficulty, but taken together, they will collectively demonstrate the useful applications of MC methods.

Also, this is a dummy example, and we can imagine a lot of situations where we might want to write custom functions to carry out specific tasks. Much like TensorFlow, PyTorch offers to ways of declaring models: function-based and class-based methods. Although I have just started getting into PyTorch, my impression is that the later is more preferred by PyTorch developers, whereas this is not necessarily the case with Keras or . Of course, this is a matter of preference and development setting, so perhaps such first impression generalizations do not carry much weight.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"This is what is at the heart of back propagation: in one huge swoop, we can obtain the gradient for all weights and parameters at once instead of having to calculate them individually.

How do we go about back propagation in the case of our model? First, it is necessary to define a loss function. The most commonly used loss function in the context of classification problems is cross entropy, which we explored in this post previously on this blog. For a brief recap, presented below is the formula for calculating cross entropy given a true distribution  and a predicted distribution : Our goal is to train our neural network so that is output distribution  is as close to  as possible. In the case of binary classification, we might alter equation (9) to the following form: The reformulation as shown in equation (10) is the formula for what is known as binary cross entropy.

Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"The implication of this decision is that the prior collapses to a constant.

This is an informative result that tells us that, at their core, MLE and MAP seek to perform the same operation. However, MAP, being a Bayesian approach, takes a specified prior into account, whereas the frequenting MLE simply seeks to dabble in data only, as probabilities are considered objective results of repeated infinite trials instead of subjective beliefs as a Bayesian statistician would purport.

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"The  function loads the CIFAR10 data set from  module, then applies some basic preprocessing to make it more usable for deep learning purposes. The CIFAR10 data set contains 50000 training images, each labeled with 1 of 10 classes, ranging from cats, horses, and trucks to airplanes. This is a classic classification task. The preprocessing occurs on two levels: first, the images are normalized so that its pixels takes values between 0 and 1. The training labels are transformed from an integer class label to a one-hot encoded vector. Let’s load the data to proceed with our analysis. Let’s see what the dimensions of the data are. Because the CIFAR10 data set include color images for its training set, we would expect three channels, each corresponding to red, green, and blue (hence RGB).

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"We begin with the likelihood ratio: We can consider  as representing how probable the sample  came from distribution  than , given that  was sampled from some unknown distribution. If , the more likely it is that the data came from ; if , the more probable it is that the sample came from . Say we have multiple independent observations of data. Then, we can use (6) to compute the likelihood ratio for each sample. Calculating the product of these ratios will tell us which distribution is more likely given all available data points. In other words, A technique we saw when we were exploring the topic of likelihood maximization was log likelihood. Log likelihoods are useful because we can reexpress products as sums, using the property of logs. (7) makes sense, but it weighs all likelihood ratios equally. In reality, most samples are not equiprobable; some values are more likely than others, unless in the context of uniform distributions. To account for this, let’s reframe (7) as an expected values calculation, i.e. give different weight to each likelihood ratio depending on the probability of observing that data point. Let’s make (8) look better by unpacking the fraction sitting in the log function as a subtraction of two terms.

Moments in Statistics,"Let’s start by simplifying the factorial in the denominator, and pulling out some expressions out of the sigma. where the third equality stands due to the variant of the Taylor series for the exponential function we looked at earlier: Therefore, we have confirmed that the mean of a Poisson distribution is equal to , which aligns with what we know about the distribution. Another way we can calculate the first moment of the Poisson is by deriving its MGF. This might sound a lot more complicated than just computing the expected value the familiar way demonstrated above, but in fact, MGFs are surprisingly easy to calculate, sometimes even easier than using the definition expectation. Let’s begin by presenting a statement of the MGF. Let’s factor out terms that contain lambda, which is not affected by the summation. Again, we refer to equation (9) to realize that the sigma expression simplifies into an exponential. In other words, From this observation, we can simplify equation (10) as follows: And there is the MGF of the Poisson distribution! All we have to do to obtain the first moment of the Poisson distribution, then, is to derive the MGF once and set  to 0.

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"The biggest difference between a simple recurrent neural network and an LSTM is that LSTMs have a unique parameter known as the carrier that encodes an additional layer of information about the state of the cell. I might write a separate post devoted to the intricacies of the LSTM, but if you’re an avid reader who’s itching to know more about it right away, I highly recommend this excellent post by Christiopher Olah. For now, let’s just say that LSTMs represent a huge improvement over conventional RNNs, and that we can implement them in  by simply calling the  layer as shown below: Because LSTM layers take a lot longer to train than others, and because the representational capacity of a single LSTM layer is higher than that of others, I decided to use only one LSTM layer instead of two. Let’s initialize this model to take a better look.  The last model we will create is a convnet, which we explored on this previous post on image classification. Convolutional neural networks are great at identifying spatial patterns in data, which is why they also perform reasonably well in natural language processing. Another huge advantage of convents over recurrent networks is that they took a lot lesser time and resources to train. This is why it is often a good idea to build a convent to establish a baseline performance metric. Let’s initialize the model with identical parameters and take a look at its internal structure.

Note that feature engineering is also applied to both the training and test set simultaneously. We have created two new features, namely  and . Let’s go ahead and perform feature engineering on the  column as well to squeeze out more information. Now we have some data that seems a lot more workable.

While a lot of this is just simple calculus and algebra, I nonetheless find it fascinating how the Basel problem can be approached from so many different angles—hence my renewed respect for Euler and other mathematicians who wrestled with this problem hundreds of years ago. As simple as it appears, there are so many different techniques and modes of analysis we can use to approach the problem. It was nice exercise and review of some calculus techniques. I’ve been digging more into the curious interchange of integral and summation recently, and when this operation is allowed, if at all. Turns out that this problem is slightly more complicated than it appears and requires some understanding of measure theory, which I had tried getting into a few months ago without much fruition.

In this post, we will explore an alternative way of solving the Basel problem using Fourier series expansion, and also discuss a alternative representations of the Basel problem in integral form. For the integral representations, I’m directly referencing Flammable Maths, a YouTube channel that I found both entertaining and informative. Let’s get started. First, let’s recall what the Basel problem is. The problem is quite simple: the goal is to obtain the value of an infinite series, namely This seems like an innocuous, straightforward problem. One can easily prove, for instance, the fact that this series converges using integral approximation. However, to obtain the value of this series is a lot more difficult than it appears—it is no coincidence that this problem remained unsolved for years until Euler came along. While there are many ways to solve this problem—Euler’s method, in particular, is one of the countless examples through which one can witness his amazing intuition and heuristic—but we will be using Fourier expansion to solve this problem, as it also provides a nice segue into the Dirichlet Eta function.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"One way to implement this process is represented below in the  function. Let’s see if the function works properly by passing  as into its argument. Great! As expected,  is a dictionary whose keys represent the class and values contain entries corresponding to that class. Now that we have successfully separated out the data by class, its’ time to write a function that will find the mean and standard deviation of each class data. This process is legitimate only because we assumed the data to be normally distributed—hence the name “Gaussian naive Bayes.” Let’s quickly see this in code. The  function receives a data set as input and returns a nested list that contains the mean and standard deviation of each column of the data set. For example, if we pass the toy data set  into , the returned list will contain two lists: the first list element corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of , and the second list element, . We can combine both  and  functions to create a new wrapper function  that returns the mean and standard deviation of each column for each class. This is a crucial step that will allow us to perform a MAP approximation for the distribution of variables for each class. Testing out the function on  created earlier yields the desired result.

"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","Euler begins his exposition by analyzing the Taylor expansion of the sine function, which goes as follows: Dividing both sides by , we obtain the following: Now it’s time to follow Euler’s amazing intuition. If we take a close look at the equation , we can convince ourselves that its solutions will adhere to the form , where  is a non-zero integer between . This is expected given the periodic behavior of the sine function and its intercepts with the -axis. Given these zeros, we can then reconstruct the original function  as an infinite product using the fundamental theorem of algebra, or more specifically, Weierstrass factorization. Let’s try to factor out the coefficient of the  term through some elementary induction. First, we observe that calculating the product of the first two terms produces the following expression: Then, we can express the target coefficient, denoted by , as follows: Where  denotes the coefficient of  obtained by expanding the rest of the terms following  in the infinite product above. If we repeat this process once more, a clear pattern emerges: Iterating over this process will eventually allow us to express our target coefficient as a sum of inverse squares multiplied by some constant, in this case : But then we already know the value of  from the modification of the Taylor polynomial for sine we saw earlier, which is !

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"This code block produces the following output: The first entry of this array, which is the value , deserves our attention, as it is the eigenvalue which corresponds to the stationary distribution eigenvector. Since the index of this value is , we can identify its eigenvector as follows: Notice that this eigenvector is a representation of a situation in which the player is in the th cell of the game board! In other words, it is telling us that once the user reaches the th cell, they will stay on that cell even after more dice rolls—hence the stationary distribution. On one hand, this information is impractical given that a player who reaches the end goal will not continue the game to go beyond the th cell. On the other hand, it is interesting to see that the eigenvector reveals information about the structure of the Markov chain in this example. Markov chains like these are referred to as absorbing Markov chains because the stationary equilibrium always involves a non-escapable state that “absorbs” all other states. One might visualize this system as having a loop on a network graph, where it is impossible to move onto a different state because of the circular nature of the edge on the node of the absorbing state.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","7 is a familiar value, and indeed it is what was returned by the Newton-Raphson method as well. We confirm that this is indeed the root of the equation. Now that we have looked at both methods, it’s time to make a quick comparison. We will be comparing three different methods: By setting  to be , we can obtain a full list of root updates as the three methods begin their quest for the root of the function. We can then see which method converges the quickest. Let’s see how this little experiment turns out. We first begin by importing some dependencies to plot the history of values. Then, we obtain the history for each of the three approaches and plot them as a scatter plot. The result is shown below.  You might have to squint your eye to see that  (Netwon-Raphson with direct derivatives) and  (Newton-Raphson with center divided difference) almost coincide exactly at the same points. I was honestly somewhat surprised by the result: although we had verified the advantage of using center divided difference over forward or backward divided difference via some simple big-O analysis with trailing error terms, I did not expect the two to coincide with such exactitude. Another interesting observation is that the secant method seems to take slightly longer than the Newton-Raphson method.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Before we get into the specifics, below are the dependencies we will need.

The GCD of 6, 7, and 1 are 1, so the returned result is  as we expect. We also notice that three numbers were returned since . Next, we define a testing function that will simulate multiple runs of the  test for us. Because this is a Monte Carlo simulation, to have confidence in our estimate, we need to iterate the sampling process multiple times until we have sufficient amount of data. The  parameter determines the number of simulations we will perform. And much like in the previous  function, the  parameter determines the upper bound of our sampling range. Therefore, the total number of simulations we run will effectively be  times.

Complex Fibonacci,"Then, in the next call of , the program recalculates the same values calculated earlier, up until the th fibonacci number, just one short of the previous one. The classic way to deal with this problem is to use a technique known as memoization. The idea is simple: we keep some sort of memo or cache of values that have already been calculated and store them in some data structure that we don’t have to recalculate values that have already been computed prior. Here is a simple implementation. To see how effective memoization is compared to vanilla recursion, let’s use the  module. Comparing this to the  test on  with memoization, the benefits of caching becomes immediately clear: 3 second and 150 nanoseconds are different by orders of magnitude, and we only asked the functions to calculate the 35th fibonacci number. We can get a sense of how quickly this disparity would grow if we try to calculate something like the 1000th fibonacci number in the sequence. Another perk of using caching as above is that we can now get the full sequence up to the 35th fibonacci number. Although memoization is interesting, it is not the main topic of today’s post.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"Simply put, a binomial distribution simulates multiple Bernoulli trials, which are experiments with only two discrete results, such as heads and tails, or more generally, successes and failures.

For example, if we perform ten tosses of a fair coin, the random variable would be the number of heads;  would be , and  would be . Mathematically, the probability distribution function of a binomial distribution can be written as follows: We can derive this equation by running a simple thought experiment. Let’s say we are tossing a coin ten times. How can we obtain the probability of getting one head and nine tails? To begin with, here is the list of all possible arrangements: Notice that all we had to do was to choose one number  that specifies the index of the trial in which a coin toss produced a head. Because there are ten ways of choosing a number from integers  to , we got ten different arrangements of the situation satisfying the condition . You might recall that this combinatoric condition can be expressed as , which is the coefficient of the binomial distribution equation.

The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"Recall that a unit circle can be expressed by the following equation in the Cartesian coordinate system: On the complex plane mapped in polar coordinates, this expression takes on an alternate form: Notice that this contains the same exact information that Euler’s identity provides for us.

Urban legend goes that mathematician Benjamin Peirce famously said the following about Euler’s identity: Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don’t know what it means. But we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth. But contrary to his point of view, Euler’s identity is a lot more than just an interesting, coincidental jumble of imaginary and irrational numbers that somehow churn out a nice, simple integer. In fact, it can be used to better understand fundamental operations such as logarithms and powers. Consider, for example, the value of the following expression: Imaginary powers are difficult to comprehend by heart, and I no make no claims that I do.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","As you can see, the loss seems to be decreasing for the most part, although it is jumpy at times. Indeed, plotting  makes it clear that the loss has been decreasing, though not entirely in a steady, monotonous fashion.  In retrospect, we could have probably added a batch normalization layer to stabilize and expedite training. However, since this post is largely meant as an introduction to PyTorch modeling, not model optimization or design, the example suffices. Now we have finally reached the last step of the development cycle: testing and evaluating the model. This last step will also require us to write a custom loop as we receive batches of data from the  object we’ve created above. The good news, however, is that the testing loop is not going to look too much different from the training loop; the only difference will be that we will not be backpropagating per each iteration. We will also be using  to make sure that the model is in the evaluation mode, not its default training mode. This ensures that things like batch normalization and dropout work correctly. Let’s talk briefly about the details of this loop. Here, the metric we’re collecting is accuracy. First, we generally see how many correct predictions the model generates.

In theory, the final function sampled through GP is considered an infinite dimensional vector, but for practical reasons of implementation, the vector in this case will be at most 60 dimensions: ten training points and 50 test points, appended together as one vector. Next, let’s build the kernel with the test points and draw random samples to see what our prior looks like. Recall that sampling can be easily achieved by performing the Cholesky decomposition on the kernel. Let’s plot the ten random samples drawn from the prior. Note that at this point, we have not seen any training data at all. The only stricture imposed on GP vis a vis the kernel is the fact that the function must be smooth, i.e. points that are close to each other in must be highly correlated.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"And we have derived the MAP estimate for the mean of the univariate Gaussian! Maximum a posteriori analysis is great and all, but what does the final result exactly tell us?

Simply put, a convex combination is a linear combination of different points or quantities in which the coefficients of the linear combinations add up to one. More concretely, We can also imagine that  and  are each -dimensional vectors, and that a convex combination is simply a dot product of these two vectors given that the elements of  sum up to one.

Now here is the important part: the implication of this observation is that we can consider the MAP estimate of parameter  as an interpolation, or more simply, some weighted average between  and .

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"This tutorial is a continuation of the “from scratch” series we started last time with the blog post demonstrating the implementation of a simple k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The machine learning model we will be looking at today is logistic regression. If the “regression” part sounds familiar, yes, that is because logistic regression is a close cousin of linear regression—both models are employed in the context of regression problems. Linear regression is used when the estimation parameter is a continuous variable; logistic regression is best suited to tackle binary classification problems. Implementing the logistic regression model is slightly more challenging due to the mathematics involved in gradient descent, but we will make every step explicit throughout the way. Without further ado, let’s get into it. To understand the clockwork behind logistic regression, it is necessary to understand the logistic function. Simply put, the logistic function is a s-shaped curve the squishes real values between positive and negative infinity into the range . This property is convenient from a machine learning perspective because it allows us to perform binary classification. Binary classification is a type of classification problem where we are assigned the task of categorizing data into two groups. For instance, given the dimensions of a patient’s tumor, determine whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Another problem might involve classifying emails as either spam or not spam.

Just to make sure that the data has been loaded successfully, let’s take a look at the first 100 characters of the string. ## Preprocessing It’s time to preprocess the text data to make it feedable to our neural network. As introduced in this previous post on recurrent neural networks, the smart way to deal with text preprocessing is typically to use an embedding layer that translates words into vectors. However, text embedding is insuitable for this task since our goal is to build a character-level text generation model. In other words, our model is not going to generate word predictions; instead, it will spit out a character each prediction cycle. Therefore, we will use an alternative technique, namely mapping each character to an integer value. This isn’t as elegant as text embedding or even one-hot encoding but for a character-level analysis, it should work fine.

To recap, let’s reexamine the Poisson distribution function: As you can see, this function is discontinuous because of that one factorial term shamelessly flaunting itself in the denominator.

Also note that we create  and  separately instead of putting them in tuple form as demonstrated above. This is just for convenience with other matrix operations later on in the post. Below is the definition for , an auxiliary function we used above to combine two  objects. Also, here is the code we use to one-hot vectorize tokens. This process is necessary in order to represent each token as a vector, which can then be stacked to create the matrices  and . Finally, let’s generate some training data with a window size of two. Let’s quickly check the dimensionality of the data to get a sense of what matrices we are working with. This intuition will become important in particular when training and writing equations for backpropagation in the next section. Both  and  are matrices with 330 rows and 60 columns. Here, 330 is the number of training examples we have. We would expect this number to have been larger had we used a larger window. 60 is the size of our corpus, or the number of unique tokens we have in the original text. Since we have one-hot encoded both the input and output as 60-dimensional sparse vectors, this is expected.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"For now, the simple observation that the performance seems to increase with more neurons, then fall at one point once overfitting starts to happen, will suffice to satisfy our curiosity. In this post, we built a neural network only using  and math. This was a lot more difficult than building other machine learning models from scratch particularly because of the heavy mathematics involved. However, it was definitely worth the challenge becasue completing and writing up this tutorial made me think a lot more about the clockwork of a neural network model. It is easy to think of neural networks as a black box, especially given the sheer ease of creating it. With just , one can build a simple neural network like this one in no time. Indeed, the main reason why I love the Keras functional API so much is that it is so easy to code and deploy a neural network model. However, when we write such models by depending on preexisting libraries, we sometimes grow oblivious to the intricacies the take place under the hood. It is my hope that reading and following along this post gave you a renewed sense of respect for the writers of such libraries, as well as the beauty of neural network models themselves.

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"It’s also not entirely fair game for the model since there are many names that might be described as multi-national: perhaps there is a Russian person with the name of Demirkan. I learned quite a bit about RNNs by implementing this RNN. It is admittedly simple, and it is somewhat different from the PyTorch layer-based approach in that it requires us to loop through each character manually, but the low-level nature of it forced me to think more about tensor dimensions and the purpose of having a division between the hidden state and output. It was also a healthy reminder of how RNNs can be difficult to train. In the coming posts, we will be looking at sequence-to-sequence models, or seq2seq for short. Ever since I heard about seq2seq, I was fascinated by tthe power of transforming one form of data to another. Although these models cannot be realistically trained on a CPU given the constraints of my local machine, I think implementing them themselves will be an exciting challenge.

Introduction to tf-idf,"The motivation behind tf-idf commences from a simple question: how do we determine the semantic importance of a word in a set of documents? On one hand, words the appear a lot are probably worth paying attention to. For example, in one of my posts on Gaussian distributions, the word “Gaussian” probably appears many times throughout the post. A keyword probably appears frequently in the document; hence the need to calculate tf. On the other hand, there might be words that appear a lot, but aren’t really that important at all. For example, consider the word “denote.” I know that I use this word a lot before writing down equations or formulas, just for the sake of notational clarity. However, the word itself carries little information on what the post is about. The same goes for other words, such as “example,” “however,” and so on. So term frequency only doesn’t really tell us much; instead, we want to pay attention to words that occur frequently in a given document, but doesn’t appear a lot in others—such words are most likely to be unique keywords that potentially capture the gist of that document. Given this analysis, it isn’t difficult to see why tf-idf is designed the way it is. Although we give priority weight to words with high term frequency, we discount words that appear frequently across all documents by dividing tf by idf, or inverse document frequency.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"If you think about it for a second, this is a very intuitive definition of randomness: the more random and infrequent an event is, the more information would be required to represent it. With this in mind, now we move onto the bigger picture: entropy in the context of random variables. In the previous section, we looked at how random events can be represented as information in bits. What’s important here was that we were dealing with isolated random events instead of random variables. For example, in the fair coin toss example, we dealt with information involved with  and , not the binomial random variable  itself. This is an important distinction to make, because entropy is essentially a probabilistically weighted average of all the random events that a random variable can take. In other words, entropy is defined as the weighted average of information given by each random event: For the continuous case, we would use an integral instead. Say  denotes the random variable of interest in a fair coin toss. Then, we are most interested in how much bits, on average, we would need to encode information generated from the distribution of this random variable. Using (3), we can easily answer this question by calculating the follows: This tells us that the entropy involved in a fair coin toss is 1 bit, i.e, on average, we only need a single digit of binary number to encode information given by a fair coin toss.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"To cut to the chase, we get And there we have it, the relationship between the Dirichlet Eta function and the Riemann Zeta function! There are many more interesting things about the Eta function, such as its convergence property, but that is a topic for another post. In this post, we developed an intuition for the implications of the Riemann Zeta function from the perspective of relative primeness and probability. The Zeta function is one of those things in mathematics that appear so simple on the surface, yet is so wonderfully complex and convoluted in the inside. Although we haven’t discussed these other intricacies of the Riemann Zeta function—in particular, its relationship to the Riemann hypothesis, which states that the Zeta function has roots at negative even integers and complex numbers whose real part is —but the approach we took here with prime numbers are probabilities is fascinating in its own right, providing ample food for thought.

Word2vec from Scratch,"In a previous post, we discussed how we can use tf-idf vectorization to encode documents into vectors. While probing more into this topic and geting a taste of what NLP is like, I decided to take a jab at another closely related, classic topic in NLP: word2vec. word2vec is a technique introduced by Google engineers in 2013, popularized by statements such as “king - man + woman = queen.” The gist of it, as you may know, is that we can express words as vectors that encode their semantics in a meaningful way. When I was just getting starting to learn TensorFlow, I came across the embedding layer, which performed exactly this operation: transforming words into vectors. While I thought this process was extremely interesting, I didn’t know about the internals of this structure until today, particularly after reading this wonderful tutorial by Chris McCornick. In this post, we will be implementing word2vec, a popular embedding technique, from scratch with NumPy. Let’s get started! Instead of going over the concepts and implementations separately, let’s jump straight into the whole implementation process and elaborate on what is necessary along the way. In order to create word embeddings, we need some sort of data. Here is a text on machine learning from Wikipedia. I’ve removed some parentheses and citation brackets to make things slightly easier.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In this optional section, we take a look at two mathematical propositions we referenced while motivating the SVD formula: first, that symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors; second, that  and  have identical non-zero eigenvalues.

Let  be some symmetric matrix, i.e. . Also assume that  has two distinct eigenvectors,  and  with corresponding eigenvalues  and .

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"As expected, we see that the result is normal, a result due to the property of conjugacy. Another observation we might make is that the posterior mean is seems to be slightly larger than 0. This is an expected result given that the mean of the numbers in our toy data set was larger than 0. Because the posterior can be intuited as an “average” between the observed data set and the prior, we would expect the posterior to be centered around a value greater than zero, which is indeed the case. Now that we have a full answer key to our problem, it’s time to build the Metropolis-Hastings sampler from scratch and compare the estimation generated by the sampler with the true analytical posterior we have just derived. Let’s go back to equation (7), which is the crux of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. To recap, the MCMC sampler works by assuming some value sampled from the proposal distribution, calculating the likelihood and posterior, and seeing if the new proposed value is worth accepting, i.e. if it is worth making a jump in the random walk. All of this sounds pretty abstract when written in words, but it is a simple idea encapsulated by (7). Let’s build the Metropolis-Hastings sampler by implementing the algorithm described above in code as shown below.

Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"We opt to drop it instead. Correlation (or somewhat equivalently, covariance) is a metric that we always care about, since ultimately the goal of ML engineering is to use a set of input features to generate a prediction. Given this context, we don’t want to feed our model useless information that lacks value; instead, we only want to feed into the model highly correlated, relevant, and informative features. If certain features in the raw data are deemed useless, we need to either drop it or engage in some sort of feature engineering to produce a new set of more correlated features.  From this preliminary analysis, it seems like there are some very weekly correlated features, namely  and . The week correlation suggests that perhaps we need to engage in some feature engineering to extract more meaningful information out of the dataset. Let’s use the findings from the previous section to engineer some more informative features. One popular approach is to make use of names to derive a  feature. Intuitively, this makes sense: Mr. and Mrs, Cpt. and Dr. might be of interest for our model. Another popular approach is to combine the less important features— and —into something like .

On Expectations and Integrals,"Imagine this process as being similar to what we learn in Calculus 101, where integrals are visualized as an infinite sum of skinny rectangles as the limit approaches zero. Essentially, we are doing the same thing, except that now, the base of each rectangle is defined as the difference between  and  instead of  and  as is the case with the Riemann integral. Another way to look at this is to consider the integral as calculating the area beneath the curve represented by the parameterization . This connection becomes a bit more apparent if we consider the fact that the Riemann integral is calculating the area beneath the curve represented by . In other words, the Riemann-Stieltjes integral can be seen as dealing with a change of variables. You might be wondering why the Riemann-Stieltjes integral is necessary in the first place. After all, the definition of expectation we already know by heart should be enough, shouldn’t it? To answer this question, consider the following  function: This cumulative mass function is obviously discontinuous since it is a step-wise function.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Also, for easier plotting, we will return the  domain range object alongside the result of our simulation.

Here, our experiment consisted of sampling two numbers, starting from range , all the way up to range , with 1000 simulations for each range. Let’s plot the results to get a better idea of what was going on.  First, notice that when , the probability that two sampled numbers are coprime is 1. This is unsurprising, since sampling from range  simply means that both the sampled numbers were 2—and of course, 2 and 2 are coprimes. However, as the range expands all the way up to 200, we see that the probability of two numbers being coprime drops precipitously, roughly converging to the value of  as we expect. Indeed, the dots seem to cluster around the gold line, which represents the value of the Zeta function evaluated at 2. But does this result generalize to cases where we sample more than just two numbers? In other words, if we sample  numbers, would the probability that the numbers be coprime approach ? Let’s find out. Given a range of  values, the  function returns a plot for each , which is effectively  in our mathematical notation.

Principal Component Analysis,"Using (2), we can reorganize (4) as follows: The last equality is due to the fact that we constrained the columns of  to be unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other.

This tells us that the optimal way of compressing  is simply by multiplying it by the transpose of the decoding matrix. In other words, we have found the transformation  in (2). For those of you who are confused about how gradients and matrix calculus work, here is a very short explanation. First, notice that  is just a scalar, since  is a column vector. Taking a gradient with respect to this quantity would mean that we get another column vector of equal dimensions with  with the following elements: And we know how to go from there. The same line of thinking can be applied to think about the second term, . We know that  is a row vector since its dot product with  should be possible dimensionally speaking. Then, we know that the gradient with respect to  should give each of the elements of , but in column vector format—hence the need for a transpose.

The Gibbs Sampler,"In order to use Gibbs sampling, we need to have access to information regarding the conditional probabilities of the distribution we seek to sample from.

We can only use the Gibbs sampler in a restricted context: namely, that we have access to conditional probability distributions. You quickly see why the Gibbs sampler can only be used in limited contexts. Nonetheless, when these set of information are available, it is a powerful algorithm with which we can sample from intractable distributions. Let’s see how this works. The gist of the Gibbs sampler is simple: sample from known conditional distributions, and use that resulting value to sample the next random variable from the following conditional probability distribution, ad infinitum. But this is just a lot of words and some needless Latin for fun and flair, so let’s hash out what the sentence really means. Continuing on from our generic example, let’s say we sampled a value from the first conditional probability distribution. We will use a superscript and subscript notation to each denote the iteration and the sequence of random variable. Assume that we start from some random -dimensional vector to start with.

How do prominent streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify provide recommendations to their users that seem to reflect their personal preferences and tastes? From a business perspective, these questions carry extreme significance since the accuracy of a recommendation algorithm may directly impact sales revenue. In this post, we will dive into this question by developing an elementary recommendation engine. The mechanism we will use to achieve this objective is a technique in linear algebra known as singular value decomposition or SVD for short. SVD is an incredibly powerful way of processing data, and also ties in with other important techniques in applied statistics such as principal component analysis, which we might also take a look at in a future post.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"We covered the topic of Markov chains on two posts, one on PageRank and the other on the game of chutes and ladders. Nonetheless, some recap would be of help.  defines Markov chains as follows: A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. In other words, a Markov chain is a method of generating a sequence of random variables where the current value of that random variable probabilistically dpends on its prior value. By recursion, this means that the next value of that random variable only depends on its current state. To put this into context, we used Markovian analysis to assess the probability that a user on the internet would move to one site to another in the context of analyzing Google’s PageRank algorithm. Markov chains also popped up when we dealt with chutes and ladders, since the next position of the player in game only depends on their current position on the game board. These examples all demonstrate the Markov property, also known as memorylessness. Later on, we will see how Markov chains come in handy when we decide to “jump” from one number to the next when sampling from the posterior distribution to derive an approximation of the parameter of interest.

Note that all we had to do is to multiply the  function we derived above, then add the backpropgation from the next iteration to account for the recurrent nature of the network. We still have a decent amount of work to do, but the fortunate news is that once we derive an expression for one parameter, the rest can also be obtained in an identical fashion.

This is not going to be a rigorous proof or a derivation, but rather an attempt at cursory analysis to provide food for thought. This process was heavily referenced from this Quora post. Intuitively, Binet’s formula has to do with the well-known fact that the ratio between two consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden ratio as  goes to infinity. In this light, we might understand the fibonacci sequence as a geometric sequence with a constant ratio. The goal, then, is to show that the ratio is in fact the Golden ratio. Then, we have the following recurrence relation between consecutive terms. Dividing both sides by , we get This is a simple quadratic equation that we can easily solve. With some precalculus algebra, we get And indeed we start to see the Golden ratio and its negative inverse as solutions to the quadratic. This means that we can express the fibonacci sequence as a linear combinations of these two solutions: Much like solving any difference equations, we have two initial conditions, namely that , .

Although this equation may seem complicated at a glance, we can develop an intuition for this formula by reminding ourselves of the definition of conditional probabilities, as well as the fact that independent events can be expressed as a union of intersections. At the end of the day, Bayes’ theorem provides a powerful tool through which we can calculate a conditional probability in terms of its reverse, i.e. calculate  by utilizing .

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"For example, we can calculate the gradient with respect to the weights of the second affine layer as follows: We won’t get into much mathematical details here, but a useful intuition we can use to derive equation (15) is to pay close attention to the dimensionality of data. Note that the dimension of the gradient as a matrix should equal to that of the layer itself. In other words, , so on and so forth. This is because the purpose of gradient computation is to update the matrix of parameters: to perform an element-by-element update with the gradient, it must necessarily be true that the dimensionality of the gradient equals that of the original matrix. Using this observation, it is possible to navigate through the confusion of transposes and left, right matrix multiplication that one might otherwise encounter if they were to approach it without any intuition or heuristics. To expedite this post, I’ll present the result of the gradient calculations for all parameters below.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Of course, this code is limited in that is only applicable to a very specific situation, namely the task of deriving the posterior given a normal prior and a normal likelihood with known variance. Nevertheless, we can glean so much insight from this fascinating function. Let’s quickly test the  function by making it sample five estimations of the mean parameter. As expected, the sampler starts from the 0, which is the default argument  and took a jump at the second sample. After that jump, the sampler rejects the next three values sampled from the proposal distribution, as it stayed dormant at the value 0.17414333. However, with more iterations, we would expect the function to make more jumps, gradually painting a picture of what the posterior should look like. In fact, we can create what is called the trace plot to see which values were sampled by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Trace plots are important because they tell us whether or not our model is well-calibrated, i.e. a sufficient amount of state changes occur.  The trace plot contains the trace of 15000 accepted values sampled from the proposal distribution. We see that there are some fluctuations, indicating that state transitions occurred, but also that there seems to be values that the sampler preferred over others. Eyeballing the trace plot, the “comfort zone” seems to be slightly above 0, as we expect.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"In fact, some weird things happen if we block time into large units, such as an hour—notice how the value of  becomes , which is a probabilistic impossibility as  should always take values between . Another issue with this model is that a Bernoulli trial does not allow for simultaneous successes. Say, for instance, that within one ten-minute block, we got two calls. However, because the result of a Bernoulli trial is binary, i.e. either a success or a failure, it cannot contain more than one success in unit time. Therefore, binary distribution cannot encode higher dimensions of information, such as two or three simultaneous successes in one trial. These set of complications motivate a new way of modeling phone calls. In the next section, we look at an alternate approach to the problem: the Poisson distribution. Here is some food for thought: what if we divide up unit time into infinitesimally small segments instead of the original ten, such that ? This idea is precisely the motivation behind the Poisson distribution. If we divide our time frame of interest into infinite segments, smaller even than microseconds, we can theoretically model multiple successful events, which is something that the binomial distribution could not account for.

However, this isn’t the worst performance considering the fact that we only had three convolutional layers. The more important takeaway from this tutorial is how to prepare data, build models, and train and evaluate them through a custom loop. From the tone and style of my writing, it is perhaps immediately clear to you that I am not officially a PyTorch fanboy. Yes, I will admit that I loved Keras for its simplicity, but after having spent more time learning python and DL, I now much prefer the freedom provided by PyTorch’s reasonably abstract API. I hope this notebook provided you with a nice, simple introduction to PyTorch. In the coming notebooks, we will take a deeper dive into implementing models with PyTorch, starting from RNNs all the way up to classic SOTA vision models like InceptionNet, ResNet, and seq2seq models. I can definitely tell you that these are coming, because, as funny as this sounds, I already have all the notetbooks and code ready; I just have to annotate them.

PyTorch Tensor Basics,"One of the main takeaways from that experience is that an intuition on dimensionality and tensor operations in general is a huge plus. This gets especially important for things like batching. One very basic thing I learned–admittedly perhaps too belatedly–is the difference between  and  as dimensions. Here is a concrete example. This creates a one-dimensional tensor, which is effectively a list. We can check the dimensions of this tensor by calling , which is very similar to how NumPy works. On the other hand, specifying the size as  results in a two-dimensional tensor. The simple, barely passing answer to the question of why  is two-dimension would be that it has double layered brackets. More exactly speaking, having an additional layer means that it is capable of storing another tensor within it; hence,  is living in a dimension that is one above that of . As mentioned earlier, batch dimension is something that becomes very important later on. Some PyTorch layers, most notably RNNs, even have an argument , which accepts a boolean value. If , PyTorch expects the first dimension of the input to be the batch dimension. If , which is the case by default, PyTorch assumes that the first dimension would be the sequence length dimension. A common operation that is used when dealing with inputs is , or its inverse, . Before explaining what these operations perform, let’s just take a look at an example. Let’s start with , the random tensor of size  initialized above.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"If we temporarily disregard the constants that show up in (6), we can conveniently trim down the equation for Bayesian inference as follows: This idea is not totally alien to us—indeed, this is precisely the insight we gleaned from the example of the potential patient. This statement is also highly intuitive as well. The posterior probability would be some mix of our initial belief, expressed as a prior, and the data newly presented, the likelihood. Bayesian inference, then, can be understood as a procedure for incorporating prior beliefs with evidence in order to derive an updated posterior. What makes Bayesian inference such a powerful technique is that the derived posterior can themselves be used as a prior for subsequent inference conducted with new data. To see Bayesian inference in action, let’s dive into the most classic, beaten-to-death yet nonetheless useful example in probability and statistics: the coin flip. This example was borrowed from the following post. Assume that we have a coin whose fairness is unknown. To be fair, most coins are approximately fair (no pun intended) given the physics of metallurgy and center of mass, but for now let’s assume that we are ignorant of coin’s fairness, or the lack thereof. By employing Bayesian inference, we can update our beliefs on the fairness of the coin as we accumulate more data through repeated coin flips. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that each coin flip is independent of others, i.e. the coin flips are independent and identically distributed.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"So far on this blog, we have looked the mathematics behind distributions, most notably binomial, Poisson, and Gamma, with a little bit of exponential. These distributions are interesting in and of themselves, but their true beauty shines through when we analyze them under the light of Bayesian inference. In today’s post, we first develop an intuition for conditional probabilities to derive Bayes’ theorem. From there, we  motivate the method of Bayesian inference as a means of understanding probability. Suppose a man believes he may have been affected with a flu after days of fever and coughing. At the nearest hospital, he is offered to undergo a clinical examination that is known to have an accuracy of 90 percent, i.e. it will return positive results to positive cases 90 percent of the time. However, it is also known that the test produces false positives 50 percent of the time. In other words, a healthy, unaffected individual will test positive with a probability of 50 percent. In cases like these, conditional probability is a great way to package and represent information. Conditional probability refers to a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred. Mathematically, we can define the conditional probability of event  given  as follows: This equation simple states that the conditional probability of  given  is the fraction of the marginal probability  and the area of intersection between those two events, .",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"In a previous post, we took a look at autoencoders, a type of neural network that receives some data as input, encodes them into a latent representation, and decodes this information to restore the original input. Autoencoders are exciting in and of themselves, but things can get a lot more interesting if we apply a bit of twist. In this post, we will take a look at one of the many flavors of the autoencoder model, known as variational autoencoders, or VAE for short. Specifically, the model that we will build in this tutorial is a convolutional variational Autoencoder, since we will be using convolutional layers for better image processing. The model architecture introduced in this tutorial was heavily inspired by the one outlined in François Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python, as well as that from a separate article on the Keras blog. Let’s start by importing the modules necessary for this demonstration. The objective of today’s task is to build an autoencoder model that produces MNIST hand-written digits. The hidden dimension, or the latent space of the model, is going to a random vector living in two-dimensional space. Let’s specify this setup, along with some other miscellaneous configurations, before we proceed with constructing the model architecture. It’s time to build our model… or not quite now. Before we start stacking layers for the encoder and the decoder, we need to define a sampling function that will perform the meat of the variational inference involved in VAE.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","But before we jump into it, let’s briefly go over some basics of matrix calculus, which is the variant of calculus we will be using throughout. Much like we can derive a function by a variable, say  or , loosely speaking, we can derive a function by a matrix. More strictly speaking, this so-called derivative of a matrix is more formally known as the gradient. The reason why we introduced the gradient as a derivative by a matrix is that, in many ways, the gradient in matrix calculus resembles a lot of what we saw with derivatives in single variable calculus. For the most part, this intuition is constructive and helpful, and the few caveats where this intuition breaks down are beyond the purposes of this post. For now, let’s stick to that intuition as we venture into the topic of gradient. As we always like to do, let’s throw out the equation first to see what we’re getting into before anything else. We can represent the gradient of function  with respect to matrix  is a matrix of partial derivatives, defined as While this formula might seem complicated, in reality, it is just a convenient way of packaging partial derivatives of the function into a compact matrix.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"” While working at Bell Labs, Shannon was experimenting with methods to most efficiently encode and transmit data without loss of information. It is in this context that Shannon proposed the notion of entropy, which he roughly defined as the smallest possible size of lossless encoding of a message that can be achieved for transmission. Of course, there is a corresponding mathematical definition for entropy. But before we jump straight into entropy, let’s try to  develop some preliminary intuition on the concept of information, which is the building block of entropy. What is information? Warren Weaver, who popularized Shannon’s works and together developed the field of information theory, pointed out that information is not related to what is said, but what could be said. This element of uncertainty involved in one’s degree of freedom is what makes the notion of information inseparable from probability and randomness. As Ian Goodfellow put it in Deep Learning, The basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely event has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has occurred. In other words, a low probability event expresses a lot of information, while a high probability event expresses low information as its occurrence provides little information of value to the informed. Put differently, rare events require more information to represent than common ones. Consider, for example, how we might represent the amount of information involved in a fair coin toss.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In eigendecomposition, the factors were all square matrices whose dimension was identical to that of the matrix that we sought to decompose. In SVD, however, since the target matrix can be rectangular, the factors are always of the same shape. The second point to note is that  and  are orthogonal matrices; , a diagonal matrix. This decomposition structure is similar to that of eigendecomposition, and this is no coincidence: in fact, formula (1) can simply be shown by performing an eigendecomposition on  and . Let’s begin by calculating the first case, , assuming formiula (1). This process looks as follows: The last equality stands since the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is equal to its transpose. Substituting  for , equation (2) simplifies to And we finally have what we have seen with eigendecomposition: a matrix of independent vectors equal to the rank of the original matrix, a diagonal matrix, and an inverse. Indeed, what we have in (3) is an eigendecomposition of the matrix . Intuitively speaking, because matrix  is not necessarily square, we calculate  to make it square, then perform the familiar eigendecomposition. Note that we have orthogonal eigenvectors in this case because  is a symmetric matrix—more specifically, positive semi-definite. We won’t get into this subtopic too much, but we will explore a very simple proof for this property, so don’t worry. For now, let’s continue with our exploration of the SVD formula by turning our attention from matrix —a factor of eigendecomposition on —to the matrix .",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"However, we can get a bit more scientific by calculating the cross entropy to see exactly how well our model performed with the given data. To achieve this, let’s quickly write some functions to calculate KL divergence and cross entropy. We will be reusing the  function we defined above. On a trivial note, we prevent Python from running into math domain errors, we add  to the provided distribution if the list contains 0. The result is unsurprising. If we recall that the definition of entropy is the amount of information content needed to encode information, we will quickly realize that  is a distribution with probability 1, which is why it makes sense that entropy converges to 0. Therefore, in this case, KL divergence equals cross entropy, which computes to approximately 0.415. What actually happened beneath the hood? If we recall the definition of cross entropy, we can easily see that, among the 10 terms, 9 of them were eliminated since  given the setup of the distribution . In the end, the only term that mattered was the third term, which was given by Why does this quantity make sense as an error term defining a loss function?

InceptionNet in PyTorch,"To be honest, I don’t think the output of the print statement is that helpful; all we know is that the model is huge, and that there is a lot of room for error. So let’s conduct a quick sanity check with a dummy input to see if the model works properly. Great! We’ve passed to the model a batch containing two RGB images of size 224-by-224, which is the standard input assumed by the InceptionNet model. We get in return a tensor of shape , which means we got two predictions, as expected. I’m not going to train this model on my GPU-less MacBook, and if you want to use InceptionNet, there are plenty of places to find pretrained models ready to be used right out of the box. However, I still think implementing this model helped me gain a finer grasp of PyTorch. I can say this with full confidence because a full month has passed since I coded out this Jupyter notebook, and I feel a lot more confident in PyTorch than I used to before.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","However, this is obviously not the most systematic approach, and there is not even a clear guideline as to how they should go about pulling these levers. Here is where the Bayesian approach comes in handy. It isn’t difficult to frame this as a Bayesian problem. Given a pull of the slot machine, the result of which we will denote as , a Bernoulli random variable, we can then formulate the problem as follows: And as the classical Bayesian analysis goes, the more data we collect through repeated experiments, the closer the posterior distribution will get to the target distribution. Through this process, we are able to approximate the parameter . Now we have to think about what distributions we want to use for the prior and likelihood. Let’s start with the easier one: the likelihood. The natural choice that makes sense is the binomial distribution. Each pull on the lever can be considered a Bernoulli trial, and as we start exploring with more pulls to accumulate data, we will essentially be sampling from a binomial distribution, with  success and  failures out of a total of  trials. Therefore, more concretely, we can say The more interesting part is the prior distribution. Intuitively, the one might be inclined to say that we need a uniform prior, and indeed that answer would technically be true.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","Recently, I ran into an interesting video on YouTube on numerical methods (at this pont, I can’t help but wonder if YouTube can read my mind, but now I digress). It was a channel called numericalmethodsguy, run by a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Florida. While the videos themselves were recorded a while back in 2009 at just 240p, I found the contents of the video to be very intriguing and easily digestable. His videos did not seem to assume much mathematical knowledge beyond basic high school calculus. After watching a few of his videos, I decided to implement some numerical methods algorithms in Python. Specifically, this post will deal with mainly two methods of solving non-linear equations: the Newton-Raphson method and the secant method. Let’s dive right into it. Before we move on, it’s first necessary to come up with a way of representing equations in Python. For the sake of simplicity, let’s first just consider polynomials. The most obvious, simplest way of representing polynomials in Python is to simply use functions. For example, we can express  as However, a downside of this approach is the fact that it’s difficult to directly derive this equation despite the fact that it is nothing more than just a simple polynomial. So instead, we will use a list index-based representation. Namely, the  th element of a list represents the coefficient of the th power in a polynomial equation.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Because we were dealing with a very simple example of biased coins, entropy values we calculated did not go past 1 bits, but we can easily imagine situations were it might, such as a dice roll or more complicated real-life examples. In this light, entropy is one metric with which we can quantify randomness, which is the mission we set out to accomplish in this post. But entropy is a lot more than just an interesting concept on randomness. Entropy has wide ranging applications, especially in the field of machine learning and neural networks. Among these, we will be looking at cross entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, two derivative concepts of entropy that are arguably most commonly used. Let’s start with the big picture first—when these concepts are used, what is the relationship between the two, why they are important—and move onto the details later. First, we have to know that cross entropy, unlike just entropy, deals with two probability distributions instead of one. Specifically, cross entropy is a way of measuring the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. In a typical scenario, we might have a true probability distribution  that we are trying to model, and our deep learning algorithm might produce some approximate probability distribution . We might evaluate the effectiveness of our model by calculating the distance between  and . Seen in this light, cross entropy can be interpreted as a target cost function to be minimized.

Gamma and Zeta,"At any rate, it’s both interesting and yet also unsurprising to see that these two functions are brainchildren of Gauss and Euler, two names that arguably appear the most in the world of math. The Riemann zeta function is perhaps one of the most famous functions in the world of analysis. It is also sometimes referred to as the Euler-Riemann zeta function, but at this point, prefixing something with “Euler” loses significance since just about everything in mathematics seems to have some Euler prefix in front of it. The Riemann zeta function takes the following form: But this definition, as simple and intuitive as it is, seems to erroneously suggest that the Riemann zeta function is only defined over non-negative integers. This is certainly not the case. In fact, the reason why the Riemann zeta function is so widely studied in mathematics is that its domain ranges over the complex number plane. While we won’t be discussing the complexity of the Riemann zeta function in this regard (no pun intended), it is nonetheless important to consider about how we might calculate, say, . This is where the Gamma function comes in. As hinted earlier, an alternative definition of the Riemann zeta function can be constructed using the Gamma function that takes the Riemann zeta beyond the obvious realm of integers and into the real domain.

The Gibbs Sampler,"Heuristically, we know that the addition in  will become a multiplication when plugged back into the original formula for the multivariate Gaussian as shown in (3), using (4).

Using this heuristic, we conclude that Notice that this result is exactly what we have in the function which we used to sample from the conditional distribution. The Gibbs sampler is another very interesting algorithm we can use to sample from complicated, intractable distributions. Although the use case of the Gibbs sampler is somewhat limited due to the fact that we need to be able to access the conditional distribution, it is a powerful algorithm nonetheless. We also discussed the notion of conditional distributions of the multivariate Gaussian in this post. The derivation was not the simplest, and granted we omitted a lot of algebra along the way, but it was a good mental exercise nonetheless.

Word2vec from Scratch,"An obvious sanity check we can perform is to see which token our model predicts given the word “learning.” If the model was trained properly, the most likely word should understandably be “machine.” And indeed, when that is the result we get: notice that “machine” is at the top of the list of tokens, sorted by degree of affinity with “learning.” Building and training was fun and all, but our end goal was not to build a neural network; we wanted to get word embeddings. As stated earlier in this post, the key behind word embeddings is that the rows of the first weight matrix is effectively a dense representation of one-hot encoded vectors each corresponding to various tokens in the text dataset. In our example, therefore, the embedding can simply be obtained by But of course, this is not a user-friendly way of displaying the embeddings. In particular, what we want is to be able to input a word through a function and receive as output the embedding vector for that given word. Below is a function that implements this feature. When we test out the word “machine,” we get a dense ten-dimensional vector as expected. And of course, this vector is not a collection of some randomly initialized numbers, but a result of training with context data generated through the sliding window algorithm described above.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Note that we can always generalize such quantities into moments. Given , the expected value of the Beta random variable can be expressed as Proving this is pretty straightforward if we simply use the law of the unconscious statistician. Using the definition of expectation, we can derive the following: Here, we use the Gamma representation of the Beta function. This conclusion gives an even nicer, more intuitive interpretation of the Bayesian update we saw earlier with the Beta prior and binomial likelihood. Namely, given the new posterior we know that sampling from that new posterior will give us a mean value that somewhat resembles the crude approach we would have taken without the prior expectation. Here, the crude approach is referring to the raw frequentist estimate we would have made had we not taken the Bayesian approach to the problem. It is obvious that the two hyperparameters of the prior are acting as an initial weight of sorts, making sure that when little data is available, the prior overshadows observations, but when ample amount of data is collected and available, eventually yields to those observations to estimate the parameter. Now we can turn our attention back to the multi-armed bandit problem. Now we can build on top of our knowledge of the Beta-Binomial update and refine what the frequentist greedy approach.

To briefly recap, the Poisson distribution can be considered as an variation of the binomial distribution where the number of trials, , diverges to infinity, with rate of success defined as . This is why the Poisson distribution is frequently used to model how many random events are likely in a given time frame. Here is the probability distribution of the Poisson distribution.

Fourier Series,"For example, The same applies to cosines and sines: where  and  can be any integer.

It’s time to sit back and let the magic unfold when we multiply  to (1) and integrate the entire expression. If we divide both sides of (5) by , you will realize that we have derived an expression for the constant corresponding to the  expansion term: The key takeaway here is this: by exploiting orthogonality, we can knock out every term but one, the very term that we multiplied to the expansion. By the same token, therefore, we can  deduce that we can do the same for the sine terms: The only small caveat is that the case is a bit more specific for .

"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","The more I continue my journey down the rabbit hole of mathematics, the more often I stumble across one name: Leonhard Euler. Nearly every concept that I learn, in one way or another, seems to be built on top of some strand of his work, not to mention the unending list of constants, formulas, and series that bears his name. It is simply mind-blowing to imagine that a single person could be so creative, inventive, and productive to the extent that the field of mathematics would not be where it is today had it not been for his birth on April 15, 1707. Why such intensive fanboying, you might ask. Well, let’s remind ourselves of the fact that the interpolation of the factorial through the Gamma function was spearheaded by Euler himself. But this is just the start of the beginning. Consider, for example, the Basel problem, an infamous problem that mathematicians have been trying to solve for nearly a century with no avail, until the 28-year-old Euler came to the rescue. The Basel problem can be stated as follows: At a glance, this seems like a fairly simple problem. Indeed, we know that this series converges to a real value.

I’m still far from reaching that level of knowledge, but I thought I’d take a jab at it nonetheless. After all, I realized that sitting down to write a blog post about some concept forces me to study more, so it is a positive, self-reinforcing cycle. Let’s begin. Fisher’s score function is deeply related to maximum likelihood estimation. In fact, it’s something that we already know–we just haven’t defined it explicitly as Fisher’s score before. First, we begin with the definition of the likelihood function. Assume some dataset  where each observation is identically and independently distributed according to a true underlying distribution parametrized by . Given this probability density function , we can write the likelihood function as follows: While it is sometimes the convention that the likelihood function be denoted as , we opt for an alternative notation to reserve  for the loss function.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Although the rate of convergence dramatically decreases after the first few iterations, the pattern of convergence is apparrent. So how does this work? The mechanism is extremely simple: if we were to randomly generate an infinite number of dots, the proportion of the number of dots that fall within the circle versus those that do not fall within it would converge to some constant, i.e. . Why is this the case? Intuitively, the larger the area, the larger the number of points that fall into that area. Given this proportional relationship, the number of randomly generated points in an area after a simulation would mirror the actual area of the circle and the rectangle, hence the proportional expression above. By following this line of reasoning, we can then resort to Monte Carlo to generate these random points, after which we can make a reasonable estimation of . But approximation is not the only domain in which Monte Carlo methods become useful–they can also be used to calculate complicated integrals. We all know from calculus class that integration can be difficult. Everyone has encountered integrals of varying monstrosity at one point in their lives, scrambling to solve it with integration by parts or some obscure, creative substitution, only to realize that everything wounds up in the middle of nowhere.

A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now, all we have to do is to train the model with the data. Let’s run this for 50 epochs, just to give our model enough time to explore the loss function and settle on a good minimum. As I was training this model on Google Colab, I noticed that training even this simple model took a lot of time. Therefore, I decided that it is a good idea to probably save the trained model—in the worst case scenario that poor network connection suddenly caused the Jupyter kernel to die, saving a saved model file would be of huge help since I can continue training again from there. Saving the model on Google Colab requires us to import a simple module, . The process is very simple. To load the model, we can simply call the command below. Let’s take a look at the loss curve of the model. We can simply look at the value of the loss function as printed throughout the training scheme, but why not visualize it if we can?  As expected, the loss decreases throughout each epoch. The reason I was not paticularly worried about overfitting was that we had so much data to work with, especially in comparison with the relatively constrained memory capacity of our one-layered model.

The  argument specifies the number of experiments we want to conduct. This way, we can calculate the mean accuracy, just as we did previously. Let’s call the function to create a plot.  The result shows that the performance of the neural network generally increases as the number of neurons increase. We don’t see signs of overfitting, but we know it happens: recall that our neural network model with 99 and 64 hidden neurons hit an accuracy of about 95 percent, whereas the model with only 30 to 40 neurons seem to be outperforming this metric by an accuracy hovering around 98 percent. After having realized this, I considered re-running the  function with a different range, but eventuially decided to stop the experiment  because running the  function took a lot more time than I had expected, even on Google Colab.

In the Beta distribution, the Beta function which appears in the denominator is simply a normalizing constant that ensures that integrating the probability distribution function from 0 to 1 produces 1. The specifics of the Beta function and how it relates to the Gamma function might be a topic for a another post. For now, it suffices to show the general probability function as well as its building blocks, namely the Beta function itself. These will become relevant later when we derive the posterior with a binomial likelihood function to show conjugacy. To prove conjugacy, it suffices to show that multiplying a Beta prior with a binomial likelihood produces a Beta posterior. Roughly speaking, the big picture we will be using is essentially equation (1). For notation consistency, I decided to use  for conditional probability and  for function parametrization. For a rather pedantic discussion on this notational convention, I recommend that you take a quick look at this cross validated post.

Likelihood and Probability,"“I think that’s very unlikely.” “No, you’re probably right.” These are just some of the many remarks we use in every day conversations to express our beliefs. Linguistically, words such as “probably” or “likely” serve to qualify the strength of our professed belief, that is, we express a degree of uncertainty involved with a given statement. In today’s post, I suggest that we scrutinize the concept of likelihood—what it is, how we calculate it, and most importantly, how different it is from probability. Although the vast majority of us tend to conflate likelihood and probability in daily conversations, mathematically speaking, these two are distinct concepts, though closely related. After concretizing this difference, we then move onto a discussion of maximum likelihood, which is a useful tool frequently employed in Bayesian statistics. Without further ado, let’s jump right in. As we have seen in an earlier post on Bayesian analysis, likelihood tells us—and pardon the circular definition here—how likely a certain parameter is given some data. In other words, the likelihood function answers the question: provided some list of observed or sampled data , what is the likelihood that our parameter of interest takes on a certain value ? One measurement we can use to answer this question is simply the probability density of the observed value of the random variable at that distribution. In mathematical notation, this idea might be transcribed as: At a glance, likelihood seems to equal probability—after all, that is what the equation (1) seems to suggest.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","Below is a Python variant of the backward divided difference formula. Some tweaks have been made to the formula for use in the section that follows, but at its core, it’s clear that the function uses the approximation logic we’ve discussed so far. Another variant of the forward and backward divided difference formula is the center divided difference. By now, you might have some intuition as to what this formula is—as the name implies, we somehow use the center point, instead of going forward or backwards from the point of approximation. Here is the formula: Heuristically, this formula also makes sense. We can imagine going both a step forward and backward, then dividing the results by the total of two steps we’ve taken, one in each direction. Shown below is the Python implementation of the center divided difference formula. According to conventional mathematical wisdom, the center divided method normally provides a more robust way of approximating first order derivatives. In this subsection, we discuss why this is the case. Using Taylor expansion, we can approximate the value of  as follows, given that  goes to 0 under the limit. Notice that we can manipulate (4) to derive the forward divided difference equation in (1). If we move the  term to the LHS, then divide both sides by , we end up with Here, we used big-O notation to denote the order of magnitude of the trailing terms. The trailing terms are significant since they are directly related to the accuracy of our approximation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"These days, machine learning and deep neural networks are exploding in importance. These fields are so popular that, unless you’re a cave man, you have probably heard it at least once. The exaggeration not withstanding, there is perhaps no necessity to justify the topic for today’s blog post: exploring a machine learning algorithm by building it from scratch. Apparently, “from scratch” is now a trendy pedagogical methodology employed in many websites and resources that claim to educate their readers about machine learning. To this, I agree: by constructing algorithms from the ground up, one can glean meaningful insights on how machine learning actually works, as opposed to viewing ML as some dark magic that suddenly makes computers intelligible beings. Enough of the prologue, let’s jump right in. As the name implies, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm works by findinng the nearest neighbors of some give data. Then, it looks at the labels of  neighboring points to produce a classification prediction. Here,  is a parameter that we can tweak to build the KNN model. For instance, let’s say we have a binary classification problem. If we set  to 10, the KNN modell will look for 10 nearest points to the data presented. If among the 10 neighbors observed, 8 of them have the label 0 and 2 of them are labeled 1, the KNN algorithm will conclude that the label of the provided data is most likely also going to be 0.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Likelihood and Probability,"This code block creates two distributions of different parameters,  and . Then, we assume that a sample of value 1 is observed. Then, we can compare the likelihood of the two parameters given this data by comparing the probability density of the data for each of the two distributions. In this case,  seems more likely, i.e. it better explains the data  since , which is larger than . To sum up, likelihood is something that we can say about a distribution, specifically the parameter of the distribution. On the other hand, probabilities are quantities that we ascribe to individual data. Although these two concepts are easy to conflate, and indeed there exists an important relationship between them explained by Bayes’ theorem, yet they should not be conflated in the world of mathematics. At the end of the day, both of them provide interesting ways to analyze the organic relationship between data and distributions. Maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE in short, is an important technique used in many subfields of statistics, most notably Bayesian statistics. As the name suggests, the goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the parameters of a distribution that maximizes the probability of observing some given data . In other words, we want to find the optimal way to fit a distribution to the data. As our intuition suggests, MLE quickly reduces into an optimization problem, the solution of which can be obtained through various means, such as Newton’s method or gradient descent.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","Now, I can “move” tensors and models up to the GPU by doing something like and these statements would allow inference and training to occur within the GPU. And below are some constants I will be using in this notebook. Namely, we will run training for a total of 4 epochs, with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001. Now that we have all the things we need, let’s jump into some data preparation and modeling. Another thing I love about PyTorch is the sheer ease with which you can preprocess data. PyTorch makes it incredibly easy to combine and stack multiple transforms to create custom transformations to be applied to the dataset. The easiest way to go about this is to use the  method, which looks like this: Here, we are applying to transformations: the first changes the dataset and casts it into PyTorch tensors,, and the second one normalizes the dataset to have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of also 0.5 across all three channels of RGB. How can we apply this transform? Well, we can pass it to initialize the datasets as shown below: Because I already have the CIFAR10 downloaded in the  directory of my local, PyTorch does not download the dataset again. We could go with the dataset as-is, but we can use the  class to further batch and shuffle the dataset, which we normally want 99 percent of the time.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"But how might this number change for a biased coin? We would not expect the entropy of the random variable given by the result of a biased coin to be 1. For example, consider a coin that always lands on heads. The entropy of the random variable in this case would be exactly 0 bits, since we don’t need any information to express an event that is certain. Let’s try to figure out this dynamic between success probability of  in a coin toss and entropy by creating a plot.  The first observation to make is that the graph is symmetrical. This is no surprise, since we would expect the entropy of a random variable involving a coin that lands tails with probability  to be equal to that which lands on heads with equal probability , i.e. whether the bias concerns heads or tails should not affect the calculation of entropy. Moreover, we see that the graph peaks when , meaning that a fair coin toss involves the most randomness. In other words, this translates to saying that a skewed distribution is less random and thus more predictable than a symmetric one. This makes sense, since the result of a biased coin is more predictable and less surprising than that of a fair one, with the extreme case being the coin that always lands on one side. Seen in this light, entropy is just the total amount of information content expressed by the distribution of a random variable.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Then, the output of this embedding layer will be flattened to be passed onto a dense layer with one output transformed by the sigmoid activation function. We use the sigmoid function since we want to conduct a sentiment analysis of determining whether a given movie review is positive or negative. That wasn’t so difficult. Let’s initialize our model by defining the model parameters , , and , then plot the model to see the structure of the network alongside the input and output dimensions of each layer. Note that we defined  to be 16, which means that each word is transformed into dense vectors living in 16 dimensions. By plotting the model, we can get a better idea of the layers that compose the model.  The next model we will build is a simple recurrent neural network. This neural network is going to have an embedding layer, just like the previous model. However, instead of a dense layer, it will have two consecutive  layers stacked on top of each other. The  layer is essentially the  implementation of the  model we built earlier. Let’s take a look. We instantiate the model and take plot the network, just as we have done above.  The  model we built is, as the name shamelessly puts out, pretty simple.

The Gibbs Sampler,"So at this point, we have now empirically checked that Gibbs sampling indeed works: even if we can’t directly sample from the distribution, if we have access to conditional distributions, we can still achieve an asymptotically similar result. Now comes the mathematics portion of deriving the conditional distribution of a multivariate Gaussian, as promised earlier. In this section, we will derive an expression for the conditional distribution of the multivariate Gaussian. This isn’t really relevant to the Gibbs sampling algorithm itself, since the sampler can be used in non-Gaussian contexts as long as we have access to conditional distributions. Nonetheless, deriving this is a good mental exercise that merits some discussion. Just for the sake of quick review, let’s briefly revisit the familiar definition of a conditional probability: In the context of random vectors, we can rewrite this as Of course, if  and  are scalars, we go back to the familiar bivariate context of our example. In short, deriving the expression for the conditional distribution simply amounts to simplifying the fraction whose denominator is the marginal distribution and the numerator is the joint distribution. Let’s clarify the setup and notation first. We define a -dimensional random vector that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, namely . This vector, denoted as , can be split into a -dimensional vector  and -dimensional vector  in the following fashion: It is apparent that . Similarly, we can split up the covariance matrix  in the following fashion where , , . Also, given the symmetric property of the covariance matrix, .",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","These days, I cannot help but fall in love with Euler’s works. His proofs and discoveries are simple and elegant yet also fundamental and deeply profound, revealing hidden relationships between numbers and theories that were unthought of during his time. I tend to avoid questions like “who was the best  in history” because they most often lead to unproductive discussions that obscure individual achievements amidst meaningless comparisons, but I dare profess here my belief that only a handful of mathematicians can rival Euler in terms of his genius and prolific nature. That is enough Euler for today. I’m pretty sure that this is not going to be the last post on Euler given the sheer amount of work he produced during his lifetime. My exploration of the field of mathematics is somewhat like a random walk, moving from one point to another with no apparent pattern or purpose other than my interest and Google’s search suggestions, but my encounter with Euler will recur continuously throughout this journey for sure.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The data set contains three target classes, labeled as integers from 0 to 2, and thirteen feature columns, listed below: As I am not a wine afficionado, I have no idea what some of these columns represent, but that is irrelevant to the purpose of this tutorial. Let’s jump right in by loading the data. It always a good idea to get a sense of what the data looks like by verifying its dimension. Note that we used the  function we wrote in previous posts to shuffle and slice the data into training and validation sets. For convenience, the code for this function is presented below. Now it’s finally time to check our model by making predictions. This can simply be done by passing the training and testing data set into the  function that represented our Gaussian naive Bayes model. Let’s check if the predicted class labels match the answer key, i.e. the  array. Eyeballing the results, it seems like we did reasonably well! In fact, the line below tells us that our model mislabeled only one test instance! We can quantify the performance our model through the metric of accuracy. The  function does this for us. Note that instead of using the for-loop approach used in previous posts, this function is more vectorized, making computation less expensive. The shorter code is also an added benefit.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Forward propagation is great and all, but without appropriately trained weights, our model is obviously going to spit out meaningless predictions. The way to go about this is to use the gradient descent algorithm with back propagation. We will discuss more about back propagation in the next subsection, as it is a meaty topic that deserves space of its own. We deal primarily with the former in this section. This is not the first time that we have come across gradient descent on this blog. In fact, we used gradient descent to optimizse our logistic regression model in this post. Recall that the gradient descent algorithm can be summarized as where  represents the parameters, or weights,  represents the learning rate, and  represents the loss function. This is the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, which is also referred to as batch gradient descent. Minibatch gradient descent is similar to gradient descent. The only point of difference is that it calculates the gradient for each minibatch instead of doing so for the entire dataset as does batch gradient descent. The advantage of using a minibatch is that it is computationally lighter and less expensive. Minibatch gradient descent can be considered a happy point of compromise between stochastic and batch gradient descent, which lie on the polar opposite ends of the spectrum.

Gaussian Mixture Models,"In other words, given some data, what is the probability that it will belong to a certain class?

Using the new  notation, we can thus simplify the result down to We can then simplify this expression to derive an expression for . An important trick is here to use the fact that the covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. Therefore, the covariance matrix plays no role in driving the value down to zero. With some algebraic manipulations, we arrive at Let’s introduce another notational device to simplify the expresison even further.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"Now, we will select  number of parents to be the basis of the next generation. Here, we use a simple roulette model, where we compare the value of the probability vector and a random number sampled from a uniform distribution. If the value of the probability vector is higher, the corresponding chromosome is added to . We repeat this process until we have  parents. As expected, we get 4 parents after selecting the parents through . Now is the crucial part: mutation. There are different types of mutation schemes we can use for our model. Here, we use a simple swap and crossover mutation. As the name implies, swap simply involves swapping two elements of a chromosome. For instance, if we have , we might swap the first two elements to end up with . The problem with swap mutation, however, is the fact that swapping is a very disruptive process in the context of TSP. Because each chromosome encodes the order in which a salesman has to visit each city, swapping two cities may greatly impact the final fitness score of that mutated chromosome. Therefore, we also use another form of mutation, known as crossovers. In crossover mutation, we grab two parents. Then, we slice a portion of the chromosome of one parent, and fill the rest of the slots with that of the other parent. When filling the rest of the slots, we need to make sure that there are no duplicates in the chromosome. Let’s take a look at an example.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

To add a bit more to the excuse, I did dabble in some other topics recently, such as machine learning models or information theory, which is also partially why this post was delayed quite a bit. Nevertheless, it’s finally here and ready to go. In this post, we will take a look at the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the simplest variant among the family of MCMC models. Let’s see what the Bayesian hype is all about. It’s been a while since we last discussed Bayesian inference, so it’s probably a good idea to start with a brief recap. Bayesian statistics commences from Bayes’ theorem, a seminal statement in probability theory that can be expressed as follows Alternatively, Bayes’ theorem can be stated more generally in the context of some partitioned sample space, For simplicity, I omit the equation for the case involving continuous random variables.

BLEU from scratch,"Although this can sound like a lot, really it’s just putting all the pieces we have discussed so far together. Let’s take a look at the code implementation.

Let’s test out our final implementation with  for  from 1 to 4, all weighted equally. The  package offers functions for BLEU calculation by default. For convenience purposes, let’s create a wrapper functions. This wrapping isn’t really necessary, but it abstracts out many of the preprocessing steps, such as applying . This is because the  BLEU calculation function expects tokenized input, whereas  and  are untokenized sentences. And we see that the result matches that derived from our own implementation! In this post, we took a look at BLEU, a very common way of evaluating the fluency of machine translations. Studying the implementation of this metric was a meaningful and interesting process, not only because BLEU itself is widely used, but also because the motivation and intuition behind its construction was easily understandable and came very naturally to me. Each component of BLEU addresses some problem with simpler metrics, such as precision or modified precision. It also takes into account things like abnormally short or repetitive translations.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Using (11), we can proceed in a different direction from the definition of KL divergence. Once again, we have shown that KL divergence is positive! Proving this isn’t really necessary in the grand scheme of exploring the mathematics behind VAEs, yet I thought it would help to have this adjunctive section to better understand KL divergence and familiarize ourselves with some standard algebraic manipulations that are frequently invoked in many derivations. Let’s jump back into variational inference and defining the cost function with ELBO. Recall from the setup of our Variational Autoencoder model that we have defined the latent vector as living in two-dimensional space following a multivariate Gaussian distribution. It’s time to apply the ELBO equation to this specific context and derive a closed-form expression of our loss function. Let’s recall the formula for ELBO: After some rearranging, we can decompose ELBO into two terms, one of which is a KL divergence: Now, it’s finally time for us to dive deep into math: let’s unpack the closed form expression in (13).

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"A corollary of this simple analysis is that we can now express the probability that a given random number will be a prime number as follows, using (6): In other words, the reciprocal of the Zeta function tells us the probability that a randomly chosen number will be a prime! The more interesting part of the story is that, we can now extend this single-number example to the case of multiple numbers. The only difference is that, instead of considering whether a single number is prime or not, we will consider the notion of coprimeness, or relative primeness. Imagine we randomly sample  numbers, ranging from  all the way up to . What is the probability that these  numbers are all coprime to each other, i.e. the greatest common divisor for these numbers is 1? With some rumination, it isn’t difficult to convince ourselves that this probability can be expressed as Let’s think for a second why this is the case. The probability that some prime number  divides all  through  is going to be , as dividing each number can be considered an independent event. Therefore, the probability that some prime number  does not divide all numbers—i.e. it may divide none or some, but definitely not all—can be expressed as the complement of , or equivalently, . If we apply this analysis to all prime numbers, we end up with (6).

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"It’s finally time to test the model. Let’s first begin with data preparation and preprocessing. Now, we should have the training and test set ready to be fed into our network. Next, let’s define a simple callback application using the  monitor so that training can be stopped when no substantial improvements are being made to our model. This was included because training a VAE can take some time, and we don’t want to waste computing resources seeing only submarginal increments to the model performance. Training begins! After 14 epochs, training has stopped, meaning that no meaningful improvements were being made. Let’s visualize the representation of the latent space learned by the VAE. Visualizing this representation is easy in this case because we defined the latent space to be two-dimensional; in other words, all points can be plotted on a Cartesian plane. Let’s take a look:  This plot shows us how each numbers are distributed across the latent space. Notice that numbers that belong to the same class seem to be generally clustered around each other, although there is a messy region in the middle. This is a reasonable result: while we would expect ones to be fairly easy to distinguish from, say, eights, numbers like zeros and sixes might look very similar, and hence appear mixed as a lump in the fuzzy region in the middle. One cool thing about VAEs is that we can use their learned representation to see how numbers slowly morph and vary across a specified domain.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"In other words, it contains 4 feature columns—the width and length of sepals and petals, as mentioned earlier—and 30 observation of iris plants.

The returned numpy array contains the class labels for each of the thirty observations in the  matrix. In other words, the first test data was predicted to belong to class 1; second data, class 0, third data, class 1, and so on. Let’s compare this predicted result with the actual labels. For the most part, it seems like our predicted result is quite similar to the actual labels. But there are some samples that our KNN algorithm missed, such as the 27th data point: although its actual label is 2, our model predicted it to be 1. We can mathematically calculate the accuracy of our model by using the following function. The job of this function is quite simple: it goes through the two lists, element by element, and checks if the two values are identical. See the implementation below. The accuracy of our prediction turns out to be about 97 percent. But can we do better? Recall that we arbitrarily chose  to be 10 when we initialized the KNN algorithm.

Principal Component Analysis,"With this setup in mind, let’s finally start the derivation. As said earlier, the goal of PCA is to compress data (and be able to uncompress it) with as little loss of information as possible. We don’t want to compress data in a haphazard fashion; instead, we want the compression scheme to be able to preserve the structure of the data as much as possible in its lower dimensional representation. From this, we can come up with the following equation: In other words, the goal is to find  that which minimizes the difference between the original data and the reconstructed data. Note that finding this optimal  amounts to finding  that most effectively compresses given data. Instead of the L2 norm, let’s consider the squared L2 norm for convenience purposes. Note that minimizing the L2 norm is equal to minimizing the squared L2 norm, so there is no semantic difference. By definition of vector transpose, we can now express the squared L2 norm versions of (3) as follows: where the second to last equality is due to the fact that  and  are both constants that denote the same value.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"Next, we have to define a prior distribution for the parameter. Let’s say that  is also normally distributed around some mean  with a standard deviation of 1, as shown below. Recall that the goal of MAP is, as the same suggests, to maximize the posterior distribution. To derive the posterior, we need two ingredients: a prior and a likelihood function. We already have the first ingredient, the prior, as we have just defined it above. The last piece of the puzzle, then, is the likelihood function. Since we have assumed our data to be independently distributed, we can easily calculate the likelihood as follows: All that is left is to compute the posterior according to Baye’s formula for Bayesian inference. We can thus calculate the MAP estimate of  as shown below. The second equality is due to proportionality, whereby  is independent of  and thus can be removed from the argmax operation. The fourth equality is due to the monotonically increasing nature of the logarithmic function. We always love using logarithms to convert products to sums, because sums are almost always easier to work with than products, especially when it comes to integration or differentiation.

Stirling Approximation,"It’s about time that we go back to the old themes again. When I first started this blog, I briefly dabbled in real analysis via Euler, with a particular focus on factorials, interpolation, and the Beta function. I decided to go a bit retro and revisit these motifs in today’s post, by introducing Stirling’s approximation of the factorial. There are many variants of Stirling’s approximation, but here we introduce the general form as shown: Let’s begin the derivation by first recalling the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the probability that a certain event occurs a specified number of times within a defined time interval given the rate at which these events occur. The formula looks as follows: One interesting fact about the Poisson distribution is that, when the parameter  is sufficiently large, the Poisson approximates the Gaussian distribution whose mean and variance are both . This happens when the random variable . We can easily simplify (2) since the power of the exponent is zero. Thus, we have By simply rearranging (3), we arrive at Stirling’s approximation of the factorial: This is cool, but we still haven’t really shown why a Poisson can be used to approximate a Gaussian—after all, this premise was the bulk of this demonstration. To see the intuition behind this approximation, it is constructive to consider what happens when we add independent Poisson random variables. Say we have  and , both of which are independent Poisson random variables with mean  and .",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"You might remember back in the old days when autocomplete was just terrible.

Sometimes, it’s so good at correcting my typos that I intentionnally make careless mistakes on the keyboard just to see how far it can go. One of the obvious reasons behind such drastic improvements in autocomplete functionality is the development of deep neural networks. As we know, neural networks are great at learning hidden patterns as long as we feed it with enough data.

A module that is perfect for this job is , which accepts as input an iterable and outputs a dictionary-like object whose values represent the count of each key. Let’s test in on our dummy dataset to see if we get the count of each tokenized word. This is precisely what we need to calculate idf. Recall the formula for calculating idf As noted earlier, the intuition behind idf was that important keywords probably appear only in specific relevant documents, whereas generic words of comparatively lesser importance appear throughout all documents. We transcribe (4) into code as follows: Now, we have the idf vectors for the nine terms in the dummy dataset. At this point, all there is left to do is to multiply the term frequencies with their corresponding idf scores. This is extremely easy, since we are essentially performing a dot product of the tf and idf vectors for each document.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"And because we have infinitely many trials and only a fixed number of success, this necessarily means that  would approach 0. Although this value may seem odd, the argument that the probability of receiving a call at this very instant is 0, since “instant” as a unit of time is infinitely short to have a clearly defined probability. From an algebraic standpoint,  is necessary to ensure that , the expected number of success, converges to a real value. Now let’s derive the Poisson formula by tweaking the PMF for a binomial distribution. We commence from this expression: We can substitute  for  from the definition: Using the definition of combinatorics, Recall that  can alternately be defined as . From this definition, it flows that: But then the last term converges to 1 as  goes to : We can further simplify the rest of the terms in the limit expression as well. Specifically,  collapses to . These terms can be coupled with  in the denominator as follows: Putting this all together yields: And we have derived the PMF for the Poisson distribution! We can perform a crude sanity check on this function by graphing it and checking that its maximum occurs at . In this example, we use the numbers we assumed in the PMO phone call example, in which . The code produces the following graph. As expected, the graph peaks at .",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"In this post, we will revisit the topic of recurrent neural networks, or RNNs. Although we have used RNNs before in a previous post on character-based text prediction, we glossed over LSTM and assumed it as a black box that just worked. Today, we will take a detailed look at how LSTMs work by dissecting its components. Note that this post was inspired by this article by Kristiadi. I also heavily referenced this post by Christopher Olah. If you find any part of this article intriguing and intellectually captivating, you will surely enjoy reading their blogs as well. With this in mind, let’s jump right into it. Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, are one of the most widely used building blocks of Recurrent Neural Networks, or RNNs. This is because LSTMs overcame many of the limitations of basic vanilla RNNs: while simple RNN gates are bad at retaining long-term information and only remember input information that were fed into it relatively recently, LSTMs do a great job of retaining important information, even if they were fed into the cell long time ago. In other words, they are able to somewhat mimic the function of the brain, which involves both long and short-term memory. The structure of an LSTM cell might be summarized as follows: Note that  represents the Hadamard Product, which is nothing more than just the element-wise multiplication of matrices. This long list of equations surely looks like a lot, but each of them has a specific purpose. Let’s take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"Now, the update rule would be To solve for the argument minima operation, we will resort to the classic method for optimization: Lagrangians. In this case, the Lagrangian would be This immediately follows from using the constraint condition. To make progress, let’s use Taylor approximation again, both on the term for the loss function and the KL divergence. The good news is that we have already derived the expression for the latter. Noting the fact that there are several constants in this expression, we can simplify this into To minimize this expression, we set its gradient equal to zero. Note that we are deriving with respect to . Therefore, We are finally done with our derivation. This equation tells us that the direction of steepest descent is defined by the inverse of the Fisher matrix multiplied by the gradient of the loss function, up to some constant scaling factor. This is different from the vanilla batch gradient descent we are familiar with, which was simply defined as Although the difference seems very minor—after all, all that was changed was the addition of Fisher’s matrix—yet the underlying concept, as we have seen in the derivation, is entirely different. This was definitely a math-heavy post. Even after having written this entire post, I’m still not certain if I have understood the details and subtleties involved in the derivation. And even the details that I understand now will become confusing and ambiguous later when I return back to it.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","We can draw our own cumulative regret graph by first simulating what would have been the optimal result—in other words, we need to obtain the amount of reward the gambler would have earned had they simply pulled on the best bandit the entire time. Let’s quickly simulate that first. And it turns out that the maximum amount they would have earned, in this particular instance, is 74. I say in this particular instance, since the expected value of the maximum reward is simply 70, given that the highest success parameter is 0.7. This minor detail notwithstanding, we can now use the  quantity and the  list in order to recreate our own cumulative regret graph, as shown below.  It is obvious that the cumulative regret is highest when we start since the current reward is at 0. However, after some trial and error, the gambler starts to figure out which bandit is the best and starts pulling more of those, ultimately ending up at the point that is quite close to the maximum reward, though not quite due to the earlier opportunities that may have been lost due to exploration and sampling. In this post, we took a look at the multi-armed bandit problem and how it relates to Bayesian analysis with the Beta and Binomial distributions.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"To put this into perspective, let’s compare the objectives of a generative model with that of a discriminative model. Simply put, the goal of a discriminative model is to model and calculate where  is a label and  is some input vector. As you can see, discriminative models arise most commonly from the context of supervised machine learning, such as regression or classification. In contrast, the goal of a generative model is to approximate the distribution which we might construe to be the probability of observing evidence or data. By modeling this distribution, the goal is that we might be able to generate samples that appear to have been sampled from this distribution. In other words, we want our model to generate likely data points based on an approximation of the true distribution from which these observations came from. In the context of this tutorial, our neural network  should be able to somewhat immitate the speech of the famous German philosopher based on the training it went through with text data, although we would not expect the content generated by our neural network to have the same level of depth and profoundity as those of his original writings. As mentioned above, the objective of a generative model is to model the distribution of the latent space from which observed data points came from. At this point, our trained model should be able to model this distribution, and thus generate predictions given some input vector.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Why dense vectors, then? Can’t we simply use one-hot encoding? That is a valid point, since one-hot encoding is how we mostly deal with categorical variables in a dataset. However, one downside of this approach is that we end up with many sparse vectors. In other words, a lot of resources are wasted because the model now has to process vectors of thousands or millions of dimensions, depending on the vocabulary size. Instead of using sparse vectors to represent each word, we can simply use a denser vector of smaller dimensions to encode our data. Another advantage of this approach is that dense vectors can be used to encode semantic information. You might have heard of the famous example that “king minus male equals queen minus female.” If we were to represent the words king, queen, male, and female as vectors, we can add and subtract vectors to represent and distill meaningful information. This vector-based computation is the key to natural language processing with deep neural networks: by back propagating and adjusting the weights of our embedding layer, our model can eventually be trained to “understand” the meaning of words and their relationship with other words in the form of dense vectors. Enough talking, let’s use the embedding layer to build our neural networks, starting with the simple feed-forward model. The feed-forward neural network model will first have an embedding layer that processes input.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","We can divide both sides by  to obtain the following expression: We can then apply the substitution  to obtain Notice that we can consider the integrand to be a probability distribution function since the result of integration over the prescribed domain yields 1, the total probability. Seen this way, we can finally delineate a definition of the Gamma distribution as follows, with a trivial substitution of parameters. If this derivation involving the Gamma function does not click with you, we can take the alternative route of starting from the functional definition of the Gamma distribution: the Gamma distribution models the waiting time until the occurrence of the th event in a Poisson process. In other words, given some rate  which denotes the rate at which an event occurs, what is the distribution of the waiting time going to look like? The Gamma distribution holds an answer to this question. Let’s jump right into derivation. The first ingredient we need is the equation for the Poisson probability mass function, which we might recall goes as follows:  denotes the number of events that occur in unit time, while  denotes the rate of success. To generalize this formula by removing the unit time constraint, we can perform a rescaling on  to produce the following: where  denotes the probability that  events occur within time .

"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","We derive both sides by  to obtain the following: Notice the harmonic series embedded in the expression above.

We are almost done! Now that we have the expression for the harmonic series, we can plug it back into the original equation on  to finish off this derivation. Integrate both sides by  to obtain the following: Exponentiate both sides by  to remove the logarithm, and we finally get the alternative representation of the Gamma function: So we see that there are many other alternate modes of expressing the same function, . But the truth that remains unchanged is that the Gamma function is essentially a more expansive definition of the factorial that allows for operations on any real numbers. There are many concepts and theories surrounding the Gamma function, such as the Euler-Mascheroni constant, Mellin transformation, and countless many more, but these might be tabled for another discussion as they each deserve a separate post.

Likelihood and Probability,"And that concludes today’s article on (maximum) likelihood. This post was motivated from a rather simple thought that came to my mind while overhearing a conversation that happened at the PMO office. Despite the conceptual difference between probability and likelihood, people will continue to use employ these terms interchangeably in daily conversations. From a mathematician’s point of view, this might be unwelcome, but the vernacular rarely strictly aligns with academic lingua. In fact, it’s most often the reverse; when jargon or scholarly terms get diffused with everyday language, they often transform in meaning and usage. I presume words such as “likelihood” or “likely” fall into this criteria. All of this notwithstanding, I hope this post provided you with a better understanding of what likelihood is, and how it relates to other useful statistical concepts such as maximum likelihood estimation.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","Then, much like the Newton-Raphson method, we find the -intercept of that secant line, find a new point on the graph whose -coordinate corresponds to that intercept, and use the point from the previous iteration to find a new secant line. This process is very intuitively outlined in this video by numericalmethodsguy. The update rule for the secant method can be expressed as We can derive (7) simply by slightly modifying the update rule we saw for Newton-Raphson. Recall that the Newton-Raphson update rule was written as The only modification we need to make to this update rule is to replace  with an approximation using the backward divided difference formula. Here, we make a slight modification to (2), specifically by using values from previous iterations. If we plug (8) back into (4), with some algebraic simplifications, we land on (7), the update rule for the secant method. This is left as an exercise for the reader. Now let’s take a look at how we might be able to implement this numerical method in code. Presented below is the  method, which follows the same general structure as the  function we looked at earlier. The only part that differs is the part where we use backward divided difference, which requires that we look up not only the immediately previous root approximation, but the value prior to that as well.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"Recall that the simple, generic case of multivariate Taylor expansion looks as follows: This is simply a generalization of the familiar univariate Taylor series approximation we saw earlier.

I might write a post on this topic in the future, as I only recently figured this out and found it very amusing.) Continuing our discussion of KL divergence, let’s try to expand the divergence term using Taylor approximation. Here,  is small distance in the distribution space defined by KL divergence as the distance metric. This can be a bit obfuscating notation-wise because of the use of  as our variable, assuming  as a fixed constant, and evaluating the gradient and the Hessian at the point where   since we want to approximate the value of KL divergence at the point where where . But really, all that is happening here is that in order to approximate KL divergence, we’re starting at the point where , and using the slope and curvature obtained at that point to approximate the value of KL divergence at distance  away. Picturing the simpler univariate situation in the Cartesian plane might help. The bottom line is that the KL divergence is effectively defined by the Fisher matrix.

My First GAN,"As this competition progresses, the generator becomes increasingly better at creating fake images; the discriminator also starts to excel at determining the veracity of a presented image. Enough of theoretical dwellings, let’s begin by defining the generator model. The  is a function that returns a generator model according to some set parameters. Let’s take a look at the structure of this network in more detail.  Notice that the output of the generator is a batch image of dimensions . This is exactly the same as the , , and  information we defined earlier, and that is no coincidence: in order to fool the discriminator, the generator has to generate images that are of the same dimensions as the training images from ImageNet. Now it’s time to complete the GAN by creating a corresponding discriminator, the discerning police officer. The discriminator is essentially a simple binary classier that ascertains whether a given image is true or fake. Therefore, it is no surprise that the final output layer will have one neuron with a sigmoid activation function. Let’s take a more detailed look at the  function as shown below. And again, a model summary for convenient reference:  Now we have both the discriminator and the generator, but the two are not really connected in the sense that they exist as discrete models lacking any connection between them.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","In the process, I got a little bit extra and also wrote a function that integrates a function in list index representation format. If we integrate , we end up with , where  is the integration constant. Excluding the integration constant, we get a result that is consistent with the  function. While it’s great that we can calculate derivatives and integrals, one very obvious drawback of this direct approach is that we cannot deal with non-polynomial functions, such as exponentials or logarithms. Moreover, the list index representation is unable to represent polynomials that include terms whose powers are not positive integers. For these reasons, we will need some other methods of calculating derivatives as well. Hence the motivation for approximation methods, outlined in the section below. If you probe the deepest depths of your memory, somewhere you will recall the following equation, which I’m sure all of us saw in some high school calculus class: This equation, commonly known as the definition of a derivative, is also known as the forward divided difference formula of calculating derivatives. There is another variant, known as the backward divided difference formula: (1) and (2) are almost nearly identical, but the difference lies in which term is subtracted from who.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"In the Metrapolis-Hastings model, the proposal distribution is assumed as normal. Next, we have to decide if the current value of  is a value to accept or not. Accepting a randomly sampled value means adding it to our list of historic observations—if we draw a histogram of the entries in this list, it is our hope that we would end up with a close approximation of the posterior distribution. Accepting this value is often referred to as a “jump,” because we can visualize this process as a random walk in the posterior sample space from point  to . The question is, how do we decide to jump or not? The answer lies in Bayes’ theorem: If, for example, we should accept the value and perform the jump, because this means that the new proposed parameter does a better job of explaining the data than does the current one. But recall the dilemma we discussed earlier: how do we compute the posterior? After all, the complexity of calcualting evidence was the very reason why scientists came up with MCMC in the first place. Well, here’s a clever trick that might be of use: rearrange (5) in fractional form to get rid of the evidence term in the denominator. In other words, (5) can be reexpressed as which means The evidence term nicely disappears, giving us an expression that we can easily evaluate!

My First GAN,"This process of putting the pieces together, or adjoining the models, is where I personally find the genius in GAN design. The key takeaway here is that we define  and . As you might imagine, the shape of the input is defined by  we defined earlier. This is the latent space from which we will sample a random noise vector frame to feed into our GAN. Then, the connection between the generator and the discriminator is effectively established by the statement . All this is saying is that GAN’s output is the evaluation of the generator’s fake image by the discriminator. If the generator does well, it will fool the discriminator and thus output 1; 0 vice versa. Let’s take a look at the code implementation of this logic.  Now it’s time to train our model. Let’s first load our dataset. For this, we will be using the  images. The dataset contains low resolutions images, so our output is also going to be very rough, but it is a good starting point nonetheless. One hacky thing we do is concatenating the training and testing data. This is because for a GAN, we don’t need to differentiate the two: on the contrary, the more data we have for training, the better.

Fisher Score and Information,"To begin, let’s write out the full expression of the expectation in integral form. If we evaluate this integral at the true parameter, i.e. when , The key part of this derivation is the use of the Leibniz rule, or sometimes known as Feynman’s technique or differentiation under the integral sign. I am most definitely going to write a post detailing in intuitive explanation behind why this operation makes sense in the future, but to prevent unnecessary divergence, for now it suffices to use that rule to show that the expected value of Fisher’s score is zero at the true parameter. Things start to get a little more interesting (and more complicated) as we move onto the discussion of Fisher’s Information Matrix.  There are two sides of the coin that we will consider in this discussion: Fisher’s information as understood as the covariance matrix of the score function, and Fisher’s information as understood as a Hessian of the negative log likelihood. The gist of it is that there are two different ways of understanding the same concept, and that they provide intriguing complementary views on the information matrix. Before jumping into anything else, perhaps it’s instructive to review variance, covariance, and the covariance matrix.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"The biggest difference between correlation and covariance is that correlation is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas covariance is unbounded.

Indeed, the expression  is mathematically incoherent. However, covariance can be  a multivariate metric since we can express the covariance of any pairs of random variables by constructing what is called the covariance matrix. Simply put, the covariance matrix is a matrix whose elements are the pairwise covariance of two random variables in a random vector. Before we get into the explanation, let’s take a look at the equation for the covariance matrix: where  and . This is the matrix analogue of the expression which is an alternate definition of variance.

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"In other words, each integer corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary of the dataset. More specifically, the integer to which a word is mapped corresponds to the frequency with which the word appears, i.e. the word encoded as 10 corresponds to the 10th most frequent word in the data. We will apply some very basic preprocessing on the dataset so that we can feed it into our model. Specifically, we will preprocess the dataset such that only a  number of most frequently occurring words are considered. This step will weed out words that occur very infrequently, thus decreasing the amount of noise from the network’s perspective. Next, we will apply padding to the dataset so that all reviews are of length . This means that longer reviews will be truncated, whereas shorter reviews will be padded with zero entries. Below is a sample code implementation of this process. Let’s load the data using the  function after specifying necessary parameters. Now that the data is here and ready to go, it’s time to  build our neural network. To spice things up a bit, let’s create four different models and compare their performance.

The final icing on the cake? A fancy regression with some r-squared. In today’s post, I want to revisit what used to be my favorite tinkering toy in Excel: regression. More specifically, we’ll take a look at linear regression, which deals with straight lines and planes instead of curved surfaces. Although it sounds simple, the linear regression model is still widely used because it not only provides a clearer picture of obtained data, but can also be used to make predictions based on previous observations. Linear regression is also incredibly simple to implement using existing libraries in programming languages such as Python, as we will later see in today’s post.

Next, we generate some toy data of movie reviews and apply SVD to see how we can build a simple function that gives movie recommendations to users given their movie ratings history. Let’s jump right in. Why is singular value decomposition so important? Sure, it should now be fairly clear that SVD is a decomposition technique that can be applied to any matrix, whether square or not, which in and of itself makes it a very powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. But the true beauty of singular value decomposition comes from the fact that we can perform data compression by extracting meaningful information from the given data.

This is an interesting result, and it shows just how powerful singular value decomposition is at extracting important patterns from given data sets. Now that we understand what SVD does for us, it’s time to code our recommender function that uses distance calculation to output movie recommendations. In this post, we will be using the dot product as a means of determining distance, although other metrics such as Euclidean distance would suit our purposes as well. An advantage of using the dot product is that it is computationally less expensive and easy to achieve with code, as shown below. The  function recommends an  number of movies given that the user rated  highly. For example, let’s say some user really liked Movie 2 and is looking for two more movies that are similar to Movie 2.

At this point, it doesn’t even surprise us to know that Euler applied this line of thinking to calculate the value of the sum of higher order inverses. An interesting corollary of Euler’s solution to the Basel problem is the Wallis product, which is a representation of the quantity  as an infinite product, as shown below: It seems mathematically unintuitive to say that an irrational number such as  can be expressed as a product of fractions, which is a way of representing rational numbers. However, we can verify the soundness of the Wallis product by substituting  for  in (1): Taking the reciprocal of this entire expression reveals the Wallis product. The Basel problem is a specific case of the Riemann zeta function, whose general form can be written as follows.

In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a linear transformation is roughly defined as follows: a nonzero vector that is mapped by a given linear transformation onto a vector that is the scalar multiple of itself This definition, while seemingly abstract and cryptic, distills down into a simple equation when written in matrix form: Here,  denotes the matrix representing a linear transformation; , the eignevector; , the scalar value that is multiplied onto the eigenvector. Simply put, an eigenvector  of a linear transformation is one that is—allow me to use this term in the loosest sense to encompass positive, negative, and even imaginary scalar values—“stretched” by some factor  when the transformation is applied, i.e. multiplied by the matrix  which maps the given linear transformation. The easiest example I like to employ to demonstrate this concept is the identity matrix . For the purpose of demonstration, let  be an arbritrary vector  and  the three-by-three identity matrix. Multiplying  by  produces the following result: The result is unsurprising, but it reveals an interesting way of understanding : identity matrices are a special case of diagonalizable matrices whose eigenvalues are 1.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"For those of you who haven’t already, I highly recommend reading the post, as we developed a good intuition of when Monte Carlo simulations can come in handy to deal with tasks of varying difficulty. To cut to the chase, Monte Carlo methods are used to solve intractable problems, or problems that require expensive computing. Instead of systematically deriving a closed-forrm solution, we can alternatively opt for a scheme of random sampling and hope that, with a sufficient sample size, we would eventually be able to derive an approximation of the parameter. Although this seems stupid at first, it is an incredibly powerful approach to solving many problems, including the one presented here involving posterior calculation in Bayesian inference. The  is one of the first Markov Chain Monte Carlo model that was developed in the late 20th century to simulate particle movement. More advanced MCMC models have been introduced since; however, the Metrapolis-Hastings algorithm still deserves our attention as it demonstrates the basis of how many Markov Chain Monte Carlo models operate. Let’s get into the details of the model. At the heart of Metrapolis-Hastings is the proposal distribution, which we use to simulate the Markov chain random walk part of the model. Setting the parameters for this proposal distribution can be done arbitrarily, i.e. we can set it to be any random numbers. Theoretically, regardless of the parameters of the proposal distribution, the MCMC model would give us the same result after infinite iterations of sampling.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Let’s start by coming up with a model representation of the likelihood function, which we might recall is the probability of having a parameter value of  given some data . It is not difficult to see that the best distribution for the likelihood function given the setup of the problem is the binary distribution since each coin flip is a Bernoulli trial. Let  denote a random variable that represents the number of tails in  coin flips. For convenience purposes, we define 1 to be heads and 0 to be tails. Then, the conditional probability of obtaining  heads given a fairness parameter  can be expressed as We can perform a quick sanity check on this formula by observing that, when , the probability of observing  heads diminishes to 0, unless , in which case the probability becomes 1. This behavior is expected since  represents a perfectly biased coin that always shows tails. By symmetry, the same logic applies to a hypothetical coin that always shows heads, and represents a fairness parameter of 1. Now that we have derived a likelihood function, we move onto the next component necessary for Bayesian analysis: the prior. Determining a probability distribution for the prior is a bit more challenging than coming up with the likelihood function, but we do have certain clues as to what characteristics our prior should look possess. First, the domain of the prior probability distribution should be contained within . This is because the range of the fairness parameter  is also defined within this range.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","In the example below, we show that using  results in a very similar value (in fact, it is identical in this case, but we need to take into other factors such as numerical stability and overflow which might happen with such high-precision numbers). This result aligns with the earlier observation that center divided difference provides very accurate approximations of the first derivative. Note that the advantage of using  is that we can now apply Newton-Raphson to non-polynomial equations that cannot be formulated in list index representation format. For instance, let’s try something like . To verify that this is indeed correct, we can plug  back into . Also, given that , we can use some heuristics to realize that the answer must be only ever so slightly larger than 1. Notice that the result is extremely close to zero, suggesting that we have found the correct root. Now that we have seen the robustness of the Newton-Raphson method, let’s take a look at another similar numerical method that uses backward divided difference for derivative approximation. In this section, we will look at the secant method, which is another method for identifying the roots of non-linear equations. Before we get into a description of how this method works, here’s a quick graphic, again from Wikipedia, on how the secant method works.  As the name implies, the secant function works by drawing secant lines that cross the function at each iteration.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"Recently, a friend recommended me a book, Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet. As an eager learner just starting to fiddle with the Keras API, I decided it was a good starting point. I have just finished the first section of Part 2 on Convolutional Neural Networks and image processing. My impression so far is that the book is more focused on code than math. The apparent advantage of this approach is that it shows readers how to build neural networks very transparently. It’s also a good introduction to many neural network models, such as CNNs or LSTMs. On the flip side, it might leave some readers wondering why these models work, concretely and mathematically. This point notwithstanding, I’ve been enjoying the book very much so far, and this post is a reflection of just that. Today, we will use TensorFlow’s  module to build a convolutional neural network for image detection. This code is based on what I have learned from the book, so much credit goes to Deep Learning with Python. I have also looked at Machine Learning Mastery blog for additional reference. Let’s begin! Below are the modules that we will need to import for this demonstration. Note that this Jupyter Notebook was written on Google Colaboratory.

Gaussian Process Regression,"Given any non-zero vector , The key takeaway is that, given some positive semi-definite matrix, we can easily factor it into what we might consider to be its square root in the form of . The Cholesky decomposition is extremely useful in the context of sampling. Recall that, in a univariate setting, we can model any normal distribution by simply sampling from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance: We can extend this simplle idea to the context of multivariate Gaussians. One natural complication, however, is that variance  is a matrix in a multivariate setting. Therefore, we would somehow have to find the standard deviation of the Gaussian, or effectively its square root. This is precisely where the Cholesky decomposition comes in handy. We will be using this means of sampling when implementing GP regression in the next section. Let’s put all the pieces together. The crux of GP regression is conditioning. Recall that Here, the setup was that we have some multivariate Gaussian vector . Given some values for a portion of this random vector, namely , we can then derive another multivariate Gaussian for  using conditioning. This is exactly what we are trying to do with GP regression. Assuming that the data is normally distributed, given a number of training points and their corresponding  values, how can we make predictions at test points? In other words,  are the test points; , the training points.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"While genetic algorithms are not the most efficient or guaranteed method of solving TSP, I thought it was a fascinating approach nonetheless, so here goes the post on TSP and genetic algorithms. Before we dive into the solution, we need to first consider how we might represent this problem in code. Let’s take a look at the modules we will be using and the mode of representation we will adopt in approaching TSP. The original, popular TSP requires that the salesperson return to the original starting point destination as well. In other words, if the salesman starts at city A, he has to visit all the rest of the cities until returning back to city A. For the sake of simplicity, however, we don’t enforce this returning requirement in our modified version of TSP. Below are the modules we will be using for this post. We will be using , more specifically a lot of functions from  for things like sampling, choosing, or permuting.  arrays are also generally faster than using normal Python lists since they support vectorization, which will certainly be beneficial when building our model. For reproducibility, let’s set the random seed to 42. Now we need to consider the question of how we might represent TSP in code. Obviously, we will need some cities and some information on the distance between these cities. One solution is to consider adjacency matrices, somewhat similar to the adjacency list we took a look at on the post on Breadth First and Depth First Search algorithms.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Welcome back to another episode of “From Scratch” series on this blog, where we explore various machine learning algorithms by hand-coding them from scratch. So far , we have looked at various machine learning models, such as kNN, logistic regression, and naive Bayes. Now is time for an exciting addition to this mix: neural networks. Around last year December, I bought my first book on deep learning, titled Deep Learning from Scratch,  by Saito Goki. It was a Korean translation of a book originally published in Japanese by O’Reilly Japan. Many bloggers recommended the book as the go-to introductory textbook on deep learning, some even going as far as to say that it is a must-have. After reading a few pages in, I could see why: as the title claimed, the author used only  to essentially recreate deep learning models, ranging from simple vanilla neural networks to convolutional neural networks. As someone who had just started to learn Python, following the book was a lot harder than expected, but it was a worthwhile read indeed. Inspired by that book, and in part in an attempt to test the knowledge I gained from having read that bok, I decided to implement my own rendition of a simple neural network supported by minibatch gradient descent. Let’s jump right into it. The default setup of my Jupyter Notebook, as always: Before we start building our model, we should first prepare some data.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","In the simple, greedy frequentist approach, we would determine which bandit to pull on given our historical rate of success. If the first slot machine approximately yielded success 60 percent of the time, whereas the second one gave us 40, we would choose the first. Of course, this approach is limited by the fact that, perhaps we only pulled on the second machine 5 times and got only 2 success out of them, whereas we pulled on the first bandit a hundred times and got 60 successes. Maybe it turns out that the second bandit actually has a higher success rate, and that we were simply unlucky those five turns. Thompson sampling remedies this problem by suggesting a different approach: now that we have Bayesian posteriors, we can now directly sample from those posteriors to get an approximation of the parameter values. Since we are sampling from a distribution instead of relying on a point estimate as we do for the greedy approach, this allows for both exploration and exploitation to happen at reasonable frequencies. If a posterior distribution has large variance, this means that we will explore that particular bandit slightly more than others. If a posterior has a large mean—a high success parameter—then we will exploit that machine a bit more to earn more profit, or, in this context, to minimize regret. Before we move on any farther, perhaps’ it’s worth discussing what the term “regret” means in this context.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"In other words, our training scheme can be summarized as: But this is all to abstract. Let’s get into the details by implementing the naive Bayes classifer from scratch. Before we proceed, however, I must tell you that there are many variations of the naive Bayes classifer. The variant that we will implement today is called the Gaussian naive Bayes classifer, because we assume that the distribution of the feature variables, denoted as , is normal. For a corresponding explanation of this model on , refer to this documentation. Let’s jump right into it. As per convention, we start by importing necessary modules for this tutorial. For reproducability, we specify a . The  magic commands are for the configuration of this Jupyter Notebook. Let’s begin by building some toy data. To make things simple, we will recycle the toy data set we used in the previous post on logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors. The advantage of using this data set is that we can easily visualize our data since all instances live in . In other words, we only have two axes:  and . For convenience, we preprocess our toy data set and labels into  arrays. The first step is to separate the data set by class values, since our goal is to find the distributions for each class that best describe the given data through MAP. To achieve this objective, we can create a function that returns a dictionary, where the key represents the class and the values contain the entries of the data set.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Fourier Series,"Recall that Euler’s formula is a piece of magic that connects all the dots of mathematics. Here is the familiar equation: Using Euler’s formula, we can formulate an alternative representation of Fourier series: Let’s unequivocally drive this concept home with a simple example involving the Dirac delta function. The delta function is interesting function that looks like this:  The delta function has two nice properties that make it great to work with. First, it integrates to one if the domain includes . This is the point where the graph peaks in the diagram. Second, the delta function is even. This automatically tells us that when we perform a Fourier expansion, we will have no sine functions—sine functions are by nature odd. With this understanding in mind, let’s derive the Fourier series of the Dirac delta by starting with . The equality is due to the first property of the delta function outlined in the previous paragraph. The derivation of the rest of the constants can be done in a similar fashion. The trick is to use the fact that the delta function is zero in all domains but . Therefore, the oscillations of  will be nullified by the delta function in all but that one point, where  is just one.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"More generally, maximum likelihood estimation can be expressed as: It is not difficult to see why trying to compute this quantity may not be as easy as it seems: because we are dealing with probabilities, which are by definition smaller than 1, their product will quickly diverge to 0, which might cause arithmetic underflow. Therefore, we typically use log likelihoods instead. Maximizing the log likelihood amounts to maximizing the likelihood function since log is a monotonically increasing function. Finding the maximum could be achieved multiple ways, such as through derivation or gradient descent. As the name suggests, maximum a posteriori is an optimization method that seeks to maximize the posterior distribution in a Bayesian context, which we dealt with in this post. Recall the Bayesian analysis commences from a number of components, namely the prior, likelihood, evidence, and posterior. Concretely, The objective of Bayesian inference is to estimate the posterior distribution, whose probability distribution is often intractable, by computing the product of likelihood and the prior. This process could be repeated multiple times as more data flows in, which is how posterior update can be performed. We saw this mechanism in action with the example of a coin flip, given a binomial likelihood function and a beta prior, which are conjugate distribution pairs. Then what does maximizing the posterior mean in the context of MAP? With some thinking, we can convince ourselves that maximizing the posterior distribution amounts to finding the optimal parameters of a distribution that best describe the given data set.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The benefit of working with this dumb example is that we can analytically derive a closed-form exprerssion for the posterior distribution. This is because a normal prior is conjugate with a normal likelihood of known variance, meaning that the posterior distribution for the mean will also turn out to be normal. If you are wondering if this property of conjugacy is relevant to the notion of conjugacy discussed above with Bayesian inference, you are exactly correct: statisticians have a laundry list of distributions with conjugate relationships, accessible on this Wikipedia article. The bottom line is that we can calculate the posterior analytically, which essentially gives us an answer with which we can evaluate our implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The equation for the posterior is presented below. This assumes that the data is normally distributed with known variance and that the prior is normal, representable as For a complete mathematical derivation of (8), refer to this document. As we will see later on, we use (9) to calculate the likelihood and (10) to calculate the prior. For now, however, let’s focus on the analyticial derivation of the posterior. This can be achieved by translating the equation in (8) into code as shown below. Let’s see what the posterior looks like given the prior . For sample observations, we use the toy data set  we generated earlier.  There we have it, the posterior distribution given sample observations and a normal prior.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Complex Fibonacci,"A few days ago, a video popped up in my YouTube suggestions. We all know how disturbingly powerful the YouTube recommendation algorithm is: more than 90 percent of the times, I thoroughly enjoy all suggestions put forth by the mastermind algorithm. This time was no exception: in fact, I enjoyed it so much that I decided to write a short blog post about it. Also a quick plug: if you haven’t checked out Matt Parker’s channel, I highly recommend that you do. Let’s dive right into today’s topic: extending the fibonacci sequence to complex numbers. We all know what the fibonacci sequence looks like, but for formality and notational clarity’s sake, here is what the fibonacci sequence looks like: There are some different conventions as to where the sequence starts. I personally prefer the one that starts from zero, with zero indexing. Here is what I mean: Implementing fibonacci numbers in code is one of the most common exercises that are used to teach concepts such as recursion, memoization, and dynamic programming. This is certainly not the point of today’s post, but here is an obligatory code snippet nonetheless. The code above is the standard fibonacci function as we know it, implemented with simple bare bone recursion. While the code works perfectly fine, there is a fatal problem with this code: it recalculates so many values.

Principal Component Analysis,"Recall from (1) that reconstruction can be achieved by applying compression followed by a decoding operation: Since we know that  is just  and  is  by definition, we can express (1) in a different way. In retrospect, this is somewhat intuitive since  can roughly be thought of as a pseudo-orthonormal matrix—pseudo since there is no guarantee that it is a square matrix. Now, all that is left is to find the matrix . The way to go about this is to reconsider (3), the notion of minimizing data loss, given our findings in (6). In other words, Instead of considering a single observation, here we consider the design matrix in its entirety. Note that  is a design matrix whose rows correspond to a single observation. And because we are dealing with matrices, the Euclidean norm was replaced with its matrix equivalent, the Frobenius norm. Observe that the first term  can safely be removed from the argument since it is a constant with respect to ; let’s also change the argument of the minimum to the maximum given the negative sign. The Frobenius norm of a real matrix can be calculated as Therefore, The last equality is due to a useful property of trace, which is that we can cycle the order of matrices without changing its value.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"ReLU is a piece-wise function, and hence introduces nonlinearity, which is one of the purposes of having an activation function in a neural network. The formula for ReLU is extremely simple. If the input value  i s greater or equal to zero, the ReLU function outputs the value without modification. However, if  is smaller than zero, the returned value is also zero. There are other ways of expressing the ReLU function. One version that is commonly used and thus deserves our attention is written below. Although this appears different from (3), both formulas express the same operation at their core. We can get a better sense of what the function with the help of Python. Assuming that the input is a  vector, we can use vectorization to change only the elements in the input vector that are negative to zero, as shown below. Let’s see what the ReLU function looks like by plotting it on the plane.  The visualization makes clear the point that ReLU is a piece-wise function that flattens out negative values while leaving positive values unchanged. Now that we have all the ingredients ready, it’s time to build the neural network. Earlier, I said that a neural network can be reduced to matrix multiplication. This is obviously an oversimplification, but there is a degree of truth to that statement.

First consider the case when : When : We see that the gradient is different in the two cases! This is certainly going to important for us when calculating the gradient of , the cross entropy loss function, with respect to . Specifically, we have to consider the two cases separately by dividing up the summation expression into two parts, as shown below: That was a long ride, but in the end, we end up with a very nice expression! This tells us that the gradient of the cross entropy loss function with respect to the second affine layer is simply the size of the error term.

Word2vec from Scratch,"What is the value that we are trying to approximate, and what sort of input will we be feeding into the model to generate predictions? The answer to these questions and how they tie into word2vec is at the heart of understanding word embeddings—as you may be able to tell, word2vec is not some sort of blackbox magic, but a result of careful training with input and output values, just like any other machine learning task. So here comes the crux of word2vec: we loop through each word (or token) in the sentence. In each loop, we look at words to the left and right of the input word, as shown below. This illustration was taken from this article by Ramzi Karam.  In the particular example as shown above, we would generate the following input and prediction pairs part of the training data. Note that the window size is two, which is why we look up to two words to the left and right of the input word. So in a way, we can understand this as forcing the model to understand a rough sense of context—the ability to see which words tend to stick together. In our own example, for instance, we would see a lot of , meaning that the model should be able to capture the close contextual affinity between these two words.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Notice that this line of code directly corresponds to the formula for the updated Beta posterior distribution we found earlier, which is  refers to ,  corresponds to , and both  and  are set to  in order to take into account the initial prior which tends to a uniform distribution. An interesting observation we can make about this result is that the variance of the Beta posterior decreases with more trials, i.e. the narrower the distribution gets. This is directly reflective of the fact that we grow increasingly confident about our estimate of the parameter with more tosses of the coin. At the end of the 500th trial, we can conclude that the coin is fair indeed, which is expected given that we simulated the coin flip using the command . If we were to alter the argument for this method, say , then we would expect the final result of the update to reflect the coin’s bias. Bayes’ theorem is a powerful tool that is the basis of Bayesian statistical analysis. Although our example was just a simple coin toss, the sample principle and mechanism can be extended to countless other situations, which is why Baye’s theorem remains highly relevant to this day, especially in the field of machine learning and statistical analysis.

So What are Autoencoders?,"Of course, some information is inevitably going to be lost—after all, how can five numbers describe the entirety of an image? However, what’s important and fascinating about autoencoders is that, with appropriate training and configuration, they manage to find ways to best compress input data into latent vectors that can be decoded to regenerate a close approximation of the input data. For the purposes of this demonstration, let’s configure the latent dimension of the encoder to be 128 dimensions—in other words, each 28-by-28, single-channel image will be encoded into vectors living in 128 dimensional space. It’s time to build the autoencoder model. In summary, an autoencoder is composed of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder transfers input data into the latent dimension, and the decoder performs the exact reverse: it takes vectors in the latent space and rearranges it to bring it back into its original dimension, which is, in this case, a 28-by-28, single-channel image. The followign code snippet implements this logic using the  functional API. Let’s declare the encoder and autoencoder model by invoking the  function with the specified image shape and the dimensionality of the latent space. Just to get a sense of what operations are taking place dimensionality-wise, here is a look at the output shapes of the autoencoder model. Notice that the input is of shape , and that the final output is also of the same shape , as expected. Here’s the image of the model for the fancy bells and whistles.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Gaussian Mixture Models,"Now it becomes increasingly apparent why the EM algorithm is needed to find a converging solution for the MLE estimates. We can take a similar approach to calculate the MLE of the other two remaining paramters, namely  and . The derivation is more complicated since  is a matrix;  is subject to constraints that apply to any categorical distribution: all elements must be positive and must sum up to one. For my own personal reference and the curious-minded, here is a link to a resource that contains the full derivation. But the fundamental idea is that we would commence from the log likelihood function and derive our way to the solution. The solutions are presented below: So the full picture is now complete: given the inter-dependence of derived quantities, we seek to optimize them using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Specifically, the EM method works as follows: In today’s post, we took a deep dive into Gaussian mixture models. I find GMMs to be conceptually very intuitive and interesting at the same time. I’m also personally satisfied and glad that I have learned yet another ML/mathematical concept that starts with the word Gaussian.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"In a previous post, we took a look at Fisher’s information matrix. Today, we will be taking a break from the R frenzy and continue our exploration of this topic, meshing together related ideas such as gradient descent, KL divergence, Hessian, and more. The typical formula for batch gradient descent looks something like this: This is the familiar gradient descent algorithm that we know of. While this approach works and certainly makes sense, there are definite limitations; hence the introduction of other more efficient algorithms such as SGD, Adam, and et cetera. However, these algorithms all have one thing in common: they adjust the parameter in the parameter space according to Euclidean distance. In other words, gradient descent essentially looks at regions that are some Euclidean distance away from the current parameter and chooses the direction of steepest descent. This is where the notion of natural gradients come into play: if our goal is to minimize the cost function, which is effectively equivalent to maximizing the likelihood, why not search within the distribution space of the likelihood function instead? After all, this makes more sense since gradient descent in parameter space is likely to be easily perturbed by the mode of parametrization, such as using precision instead of variance in a normal distribution, whereas searching in the distribution space would not be subject to this limitation. So the alternative to this approach would be to search the distribution space and find the distribution that which makes value of the cost function the smallest.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"In short, document frequency tells us how frequently a given word appears throughout all documents; the inverse is the reciprocal of that quantity. In practice, we often apply a logarithm to prevent the idf score from exploding. Also, we add some smoothing to prevent division by zero. There seems to be many variations of how smoothing is implemented in practice, but here I present one way that seems to be adopted by scikit-learn. For other schemes, refer to this table on Wikipedia. However, this is a mere technically; the intuition we motivated earlier still applies regardless. With these ideas in mind, let’s go implement tf-idf vectorization in Python! In this section, we will develop a simple set of methods to convert a set of raw documents to tf-idf vectors, using a dummy dataset. Below are four documents (again, I know they’re short) that we will be using throughout this tutorial. The first step is to preprocess and tokenize the data. Although the specifics of preprocessing would probably differ from task to task, in this simple example, we simply remove all punctuations, change documents to lower case letters, and tokenize them by breaking down documents into a bag of words. Other possible techniques not discussed here include stemming and lemmatization. The  function accepts as input a set of documents and removes all the punctuation in each document. Here is the result of applying our function to the dummy data. Next, we need to tokenize the strings by splitting them into words.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
InceptionNet in PyTorch,"Specifically, we throw the model three options: one-by-one, three-by-three, and five-by-five kernels, and we let the model figure out how to weigh and process information from these kernels. In the  below, you will see that there are indeed various branches, and that the output from these branches are concatenated to produce a final output in the  function. Researchers who conceived the InceptionNet architecture decided to add auxiliary classifiers to intermediary layers of the model to ensure that the model actually learns something useful. This was included in InceptionV1; as far as I’m aware, future versions of InceptionNet do not include auxiliary classifiers. Nonetheless, I’ve added it here, just for the fun of it. Now we finally have all the ingredients needed to flesh out the entire model. This is going to a huge model, but the code isn’t too long because we’ve abstracted out many of the building blocks of the model as  or . I won’t get into the details here, as the number of parameters are simply from the original paper. As you can see, there are auxiliary classifiers here and there. If the model is training, we get three outputs in total: , , and . When the model is in , however, we only get , as that’s all we need as the final logits to be passed through a softmax function. Let’s see the gigantic beauty of this model. Great.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"As a final step, we normalize the result to ensure that longer documents do not overshadow shorter ones. Normalizing is pretty simple, so we’ll assume that we have a function  that does the job for now. Before we test the code, we obviously need to implement . This can simply done by obtaining the sum of the L2 norm of each vector, then dividing each element by that constant. Here is an easy contrived example we can do in our heads: And now we’re done! If let’s print the tf-idf vectors for each of the four documents in the dummy example. It seems about right, as all the vectors appear normalized and are of the desired dimensions. However, to really verify the result, it’s probably a good idea to pit our algorithm against scikit-learn’s implementation. In scikit-learn, the  does all the job. To transform the data to tf-idf vectors, we need to create an instance of the  and call its method, . And here are the results: There are several observations to be made about this result. First, note that the default return type of  is a sparse matrix. Sparse matrices are a great choice since many of the entries of the matrix will be zero—there is probably no document that contains every word in the corpus. Therefore, sparse representations can save a lot of space and compute time. This is why we had to call  on the result. Second, you might be wondering why the order of elements are different.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
So What are Autoencoders?,"In today’s post, we will take yet another look at an interesting application of a neural network: autoencoders. There are many types of autoencoders, but the one we will be looking at today is the simplest variant, the vanilla autoencoder. Despite its simplicity, however, there is a lot of insight to glean from this example—in fact, it is precisely the simplicity that allows us to better understand how autoencoders work, and potentially extend that understanding to to analyze other flavors of autoencoders, such as variational autoencoder networks which we might see in a future post. Without further ado, let’s get started. We begin by importing all modules and configurations necessary for this tutorial. How do autoencoders work? There are entire books dedicated to this topic, and this post in no way claims to introduce and explore all the fascinating complexities of this model. However, one intuitive way to understand autoencoders is to consider them as, lo and behold, encoders that map complex data points into vectors living in some latent dimension. For example, a 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image might be compressed into a five-dimensional latent vector. The five numbers composing this vector somehow encodes the core information needed to then decode this vector back into the original 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
BLEU from scratch,"corresponds to ;  corresponds to . Using this modified metric, we can see that the  is now penalized quite a lot through the clipping mechanism. But there are still problems that modified precision doesn’t take into account. Consider the following example translation. To us, it’s pretty obvious that  is a bad translation. Although some of the key words might be there, the order in which they are arranged violates English syntax. This is the limitation of using unigrams for precision analysis. To make sure that sentences are coherent and read fluently, we now have to introduce the notion of n-grams, where  is larger than 1. This way, we can preserve some of the sequential encoding in reference sentences and make better comparison. The fact that unigrams are a poor way of evaluating translations becomes immediately clear once we plot the  in n-grams against modified precision.  As you can see, precision score decreases as  gets higher. This makes sense: a larger  simply means that the window of comparison is larger. Unless whole phrases co-occur in the translation and reference sentences—which is highly unlikely—precision will be low. People have generally found that a suitable  value lies somewhere around 1 and 4. As we will see later, packages like  use what is known as cumulative 4-gram BLEU score, or BLEU-4. The good news is that our current implementation is already able to account for different  values. This is because we wrote a handy little function, . By passing in different values to , we can deal with different n-grams.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"The simple idea is that we can construct some matrix that represent distances between cities  and  such that  represents the distance between those two cities. When , therefore, it is obvious that  will be zero, since the distance from city  to itself is trivially zero. Here is an example of some adjacency matrix. For convenience purposes, we will represent cities by their indices. Now it’s time for us to understand how genetic algorithms work. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a biology major to understand this; simple intuition will do. The idea is that, we can use some sort of randomized approach to generate an initial population, and motivate an evolutionary cycle such that only superior genes will survive successive iterations. You might be wondering what genes are in this context. Most typically, genes can be thought of as some representation of the solution we are trying to find. In this case, an encoding of the optimal path would be the gene we are looking for. Evolution is a process that finds an optimal solution for survival through competition and mutation. Basically, the genes that have superior traits will survive, leaving offspring into the next generation. Those that are inferior will be unable to find a mate and perish, as sad as it sounds. Then how do these superior or inferior traits occur in the first place? The answer lies in random mutations.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Gaussian Process Regression,"In other words, the new kernel matrix now becomes This can be seen as a minor correction to the kernel matrix to account for added Gaussian noise. Before we jump straight into code implementation, it’s necessary to discuss the Cholesky decomposition to get some technicality out of the way. The Cholesky decomposition is a specialization of the LDU decomposition, applied to symmetric matrices. The idea is that we can factor a symmetric matrix  as Let’s begin by considering the LDU decomposition of the  matrix. We know that for symmetric matrices, . This can easily be shown by comparing the LDU decomposition of  and  respectively: Therefore, we can rewrite the LDU decomposition of A as A nice property of diagonal matrices is that we can easily identify its square, namely, where  is a matrix whose diagonal entries are each square root of the corresponding originals in . The tranpose is not necessary since  is a diagonal matrix, but we do so for convenience purposes later on in the derivation. Note the trivial case of the identity matrix, whose square root is equal to itself since all diagonal elements take the value of 1 (and ). Given this piece of information, what we can now do is to rewrite the factorization of  as where . This is the Cholesky decomposition of symmetric matrices—to be more exact, positive semi-definite matrices. The reason why the Cholesky decomposition can only be performed on positive semi-definite matrices becomes apparent when we think about the definition of positive semi-definiteness.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Instead of using hand-made dummy data as I had done in some previous posts, I decided to use the  library to generate random data points. This approach makes a lot more sense given that neural networks require a lot more input data than do machine learning models. In this particular instance, we will use the  function to accomplish this task. Let’s take a look at what our data looks like. As expected, the dataset contains the  and  coordinates of the points generated by the  function. If you haven’t heard about this function before, you might be wondering what all the moons deal is about. Well, if we plot the data points, it will become a lot more obvious.  As you can see, the generated points belong to either one of two classes, and together, each class of points seem to form some sort of moon-like shape. Our goal will be to build a neural network that is capable of determining whether a given point belongs to class 0 or class 1. In other words, this is a classic example of a binary classification problem. It is standard practice in any classification problem to convert class labels into one-hot encodeded vectors. The reason why this preprocessing is necessary is that the class number is merely a label that does not carry any meaning.

Gaussian Process Regression,"Therefore, we see little variation on test points near the data. In sparse regions where there is no training data, the model reflects our uncertainty, which is why we observe variation within the sampled functions. Comparing the region  where there is a lot of training data, and  where there is little data, this point becomes apparent. Overall, the average of the fifty samples seems to somewhat capture the overall sinusoidal trend present in the training data, notwithstanding the extraneous curvature observed in some regions. My first attempt at understanding Gaussian processes probably dates back to earlier this year, when I obtained an electronic copy of Rasmussen’s Gaussian Process for Machine Learning. I gave up on chapter 1. The book is still far beyond my current level of mathematics, but nonetheless I am glad that I was able to gain at least a cursory understanding of GP regression.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Like this, conditional probability allows us to update our beliefs on uncertainty given new information, and we will see in the later sections that this is the core idea behind Bayesian inference. Let’s return back to the example of the potential patient with a flu. Shortly afterwards at the hospital, the the man was convinced by the doctor and decided to take the clinical test, the result of which was positive. We cannot assume that the man is sick, however, since the test has a rather high rate of false positives as we saw earlier. In this situation, the parameter that is of interest to us can be expressed as In other words, given a positive test result, what is the probability that the man is actually sick? However, we have no means as of yet to directly answer this question; the two pieces of information we have are that , and that . To calculate the value of , we need Bayes’s theorem to do its trick. Let’s quickly derive Bayes’ theorem using the definition of conditional probabilities delineated earlier. Recall that Multiply  and  on both sides of (1) and (2) respectively to obtain the following result: Notice that the two equations describe the same quantity, namely . We can use equivalence to put these two equations together in the following form. Equation (3) can be manipulated in the following manner to finally produce a simple form of Bayes’ theorem: We can motivate a more intricate version this rule by modifying the denominator.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Having a uniform prior only makes sense on the very first try, when there is no historical data to estimate the parameter from. However, once we start pulling the lever and seeing the results of each consecutive pull, we should be able to build some prior expectation as to what the true value of the parameter is. This suggests that the uniform prior approach is missing some important key pieces. To really drive this point home, let’s discuss more about the notion of conjugate priors, specifically in the context of the Beta and binomial distributions. The notion of conjugate priors is something that recurs extremely often in Bayesian analysis. This is mainly because conjugate priors offer a nice closed-form solution to posterior distribution computation. Simply put, a conjugate prior to some likelihood function is a type of prior that, when multiplied with a given likelihood, produces a posterior distribution that is of the same form as itself. For example, a Beta prior, when multiplied with a binomial likelihood, produces a Beta posterior. This is what we want in Bayesian analysis, since we can now assume that posterior to be our new prior in the next iteration of experiments. In this section, we will build on top of this high level understanding of conjugacy to show that a Beta distribution is indeed a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function. On that end, let’s start with a quick definition review of the Beta distribution and the Beta function.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Likelihood and Probability,"But first, let’s clarify the fact that  is probability density, not probability. Moreover, the interpretation of probability density in the context of likelihood is different from that which arises when we discuss probability; likelihood attempts to explain the fit of observed data by altering the distribution parameter. Probability, in contrast, primarily deals with the question of how probable the observed data is given some parameter . Likelihood and probability, therefore, seem to ask similar questions, but in fact they approach the same phenomenon from opposite angles, one with a focus on the parameter and the other on data. Let’s develop more intuition by analyzing the difference between likelihood and probability from a graphical standpoint. To get started, recall the that This is the good old definition of probability as defined for a continuous random varriable , given some probability density function  with parameter . Graphically speaking, we can consider probability as the area or volume under the probability density function, which may be a curve, plane, or a hyperplane depending on the dimensionality of our context. Unlike probability, likelihood is best understood as a point estimate on the PDF. Imagine having two disparate distributions with distinct parameters. Likelihood is an estimate we can use to see which of these two distributions better explain the data we have in our hands. Intuitively, the closer the mean of the distribution is to the observed data point, the more likely the parameters for the distribution would be. We can see this in action with a simple line of code.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Word2vec from Scratch,"For backpropagation, we will need all the intermediate variables, so we hold them in a dictionary called . However, if we simply want the final prediction vectors only, not the cache, we set  to . This is just a little auxiliary feature to make things slightly easier later. We also have to implement the  function we used above. Note that this function receives a matrix as input, not a vector, so we will need to slightly tune things up a bit using a simple loop. At this point, we are done with implementing the forward pass. However, before we move on, it’s always a good idea to check the dimensionality of the matrices, as this will provide us with some useful intuition while coding backward propagation later on. The dimensionality of the matrix after passing the first layer, or the embedding layer, is as follows: This is expected, since we want all the 330 tokens in the text to be converted into ten-dimensional vectors. Next, let’s check the dimensionality after passing through the second layer. This time, it is a 330-by-60 matrix. This also makes sense, since we want the output to be sixty dimensional, back to the original dimensions following one-hot encoding. This result can then be passed onto the softmax layer, the result of which will be a bunch probability vectors. Implementing backward propagation is slightly more difficult than forward propagation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
InceptionNet in PyTorch,"In today’s post, we’ll take a look at the Inception model, otherwise known as GoogLeNet. I’ve actually written the code for this notebook in October 😱 but was only able to upload it today due to other PyTorch projects I’ve been working on these past few weeks (if you’re curious, you can check out my projects here and here). I decided to take a brief break and come back to this blog, so here goes another PyTorch model implementation blog post. Let’s jump right into it! First, we import PyTorch and other submodules we will need for this tutorial. Because Inception is a rather big model, we need to create sub blocks that will allow us to take a more modular approach to writing code. This way, we can easily reduce duplicate code and take a bottom-up approach to model design. The  module is a simple convolutional layer followed by batch normalization. We also apply a ReLU activation after the batchnorm. Next, we define the inception block. This is where all the fun stuff happens. The motivating idea behind InceptionNet is that we create multiple convolutional branches, each with different kernel (also referred to as filter) sizes. The standard, go-to kernel size is three-by-three, but we never know if a five-by-five might be better or worse. Instead of engaging in time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, we let the model decide what the optimal kernel size is.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","Plotting the Gamma distribution for different values of  and  gives us a better idea of what this relationship entails. Executing this code block produces the following figure. Notice that, as  increases, the Gamma distribution starts to look more like a normal distribution. At , the  collapses to 1, resulting in an exponential distribution. A short tangential digression: the exponential distribution is a special case of a Gamma distribution that models the waiting time until the first event in a Poisson process. It can also be considered as the continuous version of the geometric distribution. But maybe more on this later on a separate post. Returning back to the Gamma distribution, we see that altering the  also produces a transformative effect on the shape of the Gamma PDF. Specifically, increasing  causes the distribution to move to the right along the -axis. This movement occurs because, for every , a larger  value results in a decrease in the corresponding value of , which graphically translates to a rightward movement along the axis as shown. We started by looking at the Poisson probability mass function, and started our venture into the Gamma function by pondering the question of interpolating the factorial function. From there, we were able to derive and develop an intuition for the Gamma distribution, which models the waiting time required until the occurrence of the th event in a Poisson process. This may all sound very abstract because of the theoretical nature of our discussion.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Complex Fibonacci,"A simple hack that nonetheless makes a lot of sense in this case is to use the real-number line for two purposes: representing the input dimension, namely the real number line, and one component of the output dimension—the real number portion of the output to Binet’s formula. This admittedly results in a loss of information, since finding the point where  won’t give us the th fibonacci number; instead, it will only tell us what the fibonacci number is whose real number component equals . Nonetheless, this is an approach that makes sense since the real number line is a common dimension in both the input and output data. With this in mind, let’s go ahead and try to plot the interpolation of the fibonacci sequence on the complex plane. First, we import the modules we will need. Then, we simply specify the domain on the real number line and generate the fibonacci numbers, separating out the real and imaginary components. Note that  is not going to be used for plotting; instead, we use  as the -axis, and this is where the loss of temporal information comes in, as mentioned earlier. Now, let’s go ahead and plot it out!  And there it is, the full fibonacci sequence, interpolated across the real numbers.

Principal Component Analysis,"In this section, we will see how PCA is essentially a way of performing and applying these decomposition techniques under the hood. Recall that eigendecomposition is a method of decomposing matrices as follows: where  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and  is a matrix of eigenvectors. PCA is closely related to eigendecomposition, and this should come as no surprise. Essentially, by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of , we are performing an eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix: Notice that  is a matrix of principal components. Of course, in this case,  is a square matrix of full rank; to apply dimension compression, we need to slice the first  entries of . At any rate, it is clear that PCA involves eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. Eigendecomposition can only be applied to matrices of full rank. However, there is a more generalized method for non-square matrices, which is singular value decomposition. Here is a blueprint of SVD: Where  is a matrix containing the roots of the eigenvalues, with appropriate dimensional configurations to accommodate the shape of the original matrix. We cannot perform eigendecomposition on , which has no guarantee that it is square; however, SVD is definitely an option. Assume that  can be decomposed into , , and .

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This constraint immediately tells us that where  is represents the probability density function that represents the prior. Recall that some of the other functions we have looked at, namely binomial, Poisson, Gamma, or exponential are all defined within the unclosed interval , making it unsuitable for our purposes. The Beta distribution nicely satisfies this criterion. The Beta distribution is somewhat similar to the Gamma distribution we analyzed earlier in that it is defined by two shape parameters,  and . Concretely, the probability density function of the Beta distribution goes as follows: The coefficient, expressed in terms of a fraction of Gamma functions, provides a definition for the Beta function. The derivation of the Beta distribution and its apparent relationship with the Gamma function deserves an entirely separate post devoted specifically to the said topic. For the purpose of this post, an intuitive understanding of this distribution and function will suffice. A salient feature of the Beta distribution that is domain is contained within . This means that, application-wise, the Beta distribution is most often used to model a distribution of probabilities, say the batting average of a baseball player as shown in this post. It is also worth noting that the Beta function, which serves as a coefficient in the equation for the Beta PDF, serves as a normalization constant to ensure that integrating the function over the domain  would yield 1 as per the definition of a PDF.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Much like we understood  as a factor of eigendecomposition,  can be seen as a factor of eigendecomposition, this time on the matrix .

The most important difference between  and  concerns dimensionality: while  is a -by- matrix, V is an -by-. This disparity originates from the fact that  itself is a rectangular matrix, meaning that the dimensions of  and  are also different. Another point that requires clarification pertains to . Earlier, we made a substitution of  for . This tells us that  contains the square roots of the eigenvalues of  and , which, it is important to note, has identical non-zero eigenvalues. If this point brings confusion, I recommend that you peruse over the next subsection on linear algebra. Let’s conclude this section with the formula for singular value decomposition: Hopefully, now it is clear what , , and  are. Singular value decomposition can intuitively be thought of as a square root version of eigendecomposition, since essentially  and  are all derivatives that come from the “square” of a matrix, the two transpose multiples.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"I was almost about to stop here, but then decided that I wanted to express the neural network model as a Python class.

A simple neural network model in just 56 lines of code, ready to be initialized, trained, deployed, and tested! You will see that much of the code is literally just copy and pasted from the original functions we designed above.

I chose 99 as the number of neurons in the affine layers for no reason. In this instance, the accuracy of this model is 95 percent, similar to what we had above. At this point, one question that popped up in my mind was the relationship between the number of neurons and the performance of the neural network model. Intuitively, the more neurons there are, the higher the memory capacity of that model, and thus better the performance. Of course, the larger the number of neurons, the larger the risk of overfitting our model, which can also negatively impact the performance of the neural network.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Based on prior knowledge, we would expect to find the local maximum at , as this is where the bell curve peaks. If we were to dig a bit deeper into prior knowledge, we would expect the point of inflection to be one standard deviations away from the mean, left and right. Let’s verify if these are actually true. From good old calculus, we know that we can obtain the local extrema by setting the first derivative to zero. We can ignore the constants as they are non-zero. Then, we end up with Because the exponent is always positive, the only way for the expression to evaluate to zero is if This tells us that the local maximum of the univariate Gaussian occurs at the mean of the distribution, as we expect. The inflection point can be obtained by setting the second order derivative of the probability distribution function equal to zero. Luckily, we’re already halfway done with calculating the second order derivative since we’ve already computed the first order derivative above. As we have done above, let’s ignore the constants since they don’t affect the calculation. Because the first exponential term cannot equal zero, we can simplify the equation to Therefore, From this, we can see that the inflection point of the univariate Gaussian is exactly one standard deviation away from the mean.

Bayesian Linear Regression,"Although it may seem as if we made zero progress by unpacking , this process is in fact necessary to complete the square of the exponent according to the Gaussian form after making the substitutions By now, you should be comfortable with this operation of backtracking a quadratic and rearranging it to complete the square, as it is a standard operation we have used in multiple parts of this process. Finally, we have derived the predictive distribution in closed form: With more simplification using the , it can be shown that And there’s the grand formula for Bayesian linear regression! This result tells us that, if we were to simply get the best point estimate of the predicted value , we would simply have to calculate , which is the tranpose product of the MAP estimate of the weights and the input vector! In other words, the answer that Bayesian linear regression gives us is not so much different from vanilla linear regression, if we were to reduce the returned predictive probability distribution into a single point. But of course, doing so would defeat the purpose of performing Bayesian inference, so consider this merely an intriguing food for thought. As promised, we will attempt to visualize Bayesian linear regression using the  library.

Principal Component Analysis,"I found this to be the more dominant interpretation of PCA, since indeed it is highly intuitive: the goal of PCA is to find the axes—or the principal components—that which maximize the variance seen in the data. setosa.io has some excellent visualizations on the notion of covariance and how it relates to PCA, so I highly recommend that you go check it out. If were to derive PCA from the gecko with the covariance approach, we would be using an iterative approach to find a single principal component at a time. Specifically, our goal would be to find  that which maximizes Hence the problem is now framed as a constrained optimization problem. We use Lagrangians to solve constrained optimization. The intuition for the Lagrangian method is that the gradient of the constraint and the argument should be parallel to each other at the point of optimization. We go about this by taking the gradient of the argument with respect to : Since 2 is just a constant, we can absorb it into  to form a more concise expression. Also, since the covariance matrix is by definition symmetric, we can simplify things further to end up with And once again, we have shown that the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now it’s finally time to put our Nietzsche model to the test. How we will do this is pretty simple. First, we will feed a 60-character excerpt from the text to our model.

You might be wondering how the generic formula for the conditional distribution morphed into (18). While the notation might obscure their similarity, (18) immediately follows from (1). First, because we assumed zero mean, the term  simply collapses into . The same line of reasoning applies to ’ hence, the first term disappears from the mean. As for the covariance, a simple comparison is enough to show that the two equations are identical. In a nutshell, GP regression simply amounts to generating a prediction given some training data through conditioning, under the assumption that the underlying function is a infinite-dimensional vector that follows some Gaussian distribution with a kernel acting as its prior. Given this broad conceptual understanding, let’s move onto more concrete implementations. These are the setting we will be using for this post. We set a random seed for reproducibility purposes. Recall that, depsite its beautiful underlying complexity, all there is to GP regression is to identify some conditional Gaussian with a kernel as its covariance. Then, we can simply sample from this conditional distribution to obtain possible models that fit the data. As the first step, let’s implement the RBF kernel.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
My First GAN,"Generative models are fascinating. It is no wonder that GANs, or General Adversarial Networks, are considered by many to be where future lies for deep learning and neural networks. In this post, we will attempt to create a very simple vanilla GAN using TensorFlow. Specifically, our goal will be to train a neural network that is capable of generating compelling images of ships. Although this is a pretty mundane task, it nonetheless sheds lights on the potential that GAN models hold. Let’s jump right into it. Below are the dependencies and settings we will be using throughout this tutorial. Before we start building the GAN model, it is probably a good idea to define some variables that we will be using to configure the parameters of convolutional layers, namely the dimensionality of the images we will be dealing with, as well as the number of color channels and the size of the latent dimension. Similar to variational autoencoders, GANs are composed of two parts: the generator and the discriminator. As Ian Goodfellow described in the paper where he first put out the notion of a GAN, generators are best understood as counterfeiters of currency, whereas the discriminator is the police trying to distinguish the fake from the true. In other words, a GAN is a two-component model that involves an internal tug-of-war between two adversarial parties, each trying their best to accomplish their mission.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Normally, defining a loss function is very easy: in most cases, we  use pre-made loss functions that are available through the TensorFlow API, such as cross entropy or mean squared error. In the case of variational autoencoders, however, this is not such an easy task: how do we judge the robustness or the effectiveness of the decoder, which is essentially a generative algorithm? Of course, we could stop training once the figures it generates becomes reasonable, i.e. the mock MNIST digits it creates looks compelling to the human eye. However, this is a subjective metric at best, and we can’t expect there to be a ML engineer peering at the screen, looking at the outputs of the decoder per each epoch. To tackle this challenge, we need to dive into some math. Let’s take a look. First, let’s carefully review what our goal is for this task. The motivating idea behind variational autoencoders is that we want to model a specific distribution, namely the distribution of the latent space given some input. As you recall, this latent space is a two dimensional vector modeled as a multivariate diagonal Gaussian. Using Bayes’ theorem, we can express this distribution as follows: By now, it is pretty clear what the problem its: the evidence sitting in the denominator is intractable. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate or derive  in its closed form; hence the need for variational inference. The best we can do is to find a distribution  that best approximates .",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
BLEU from scratch,"I decided to use anonymous functions for the sake of simplicity and code readability. Next, let’s write a function that creates n-grams from a given sentence. This involves tokenizing the given sentence using , then looping through the tokens to create a bag of words. And here is a quick sanity check of what we’ve done so far. The BLEU score is based on a familar concept in machine learning: precision. Formally, precision is defined as where  and  stand for true and false positives, respectively. In the context of machine translations, we can consider positives as roughly corresponding to the notion of hits or matches. In other words, the positives are the bag of word n-grams we can construct from a given candidate translation. True positives are n-grams that appear in both the candidate and some reference translation; false positives are those that only appear in the candidate translation. Let’s use this intuition to build a simple precision-based metric. First, we need to create some n-grams from the candidate translation. Then, we iterate through the n-grams to see if they exist in any of the n-grams generated from reference translations. We count the total number of such hits, or true positives, and divide that quantity by the total number of n-grams produced from the candidate translation. Below are some candidate sentences and reference translations that we will be using as an example throughout this tutorial. Comparing  with , it is pretty clear that the former is the better translation.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
MLE and KL Divergence,"d) samples as shown below: Then, LLN states that A more precise statement of the law uses Chebyshev’s inequality: For the curious, here is the general formulation of Chebyshev’s inequality outside the context of LLN: For the purpose of this post, it is not necessary to go into how Chebyshev’s inequality is derived or what it means. However, it isn’t difficult to see how one might reformulate (8) to derive (7) to prove the Law of Large Numbers. All that the inequality is saying is that no more than a certain fraction of samples can fall outside more than a certain distance away from the mean of the distribution. With this understanding in mind, let’s return to the original problem and wrap up the proof. Let’s apply the Law of Large Numbers to modify the expected value expression sitting in (5): Voila! We have shown that minimizing the KL divergence amounts to finding the maximum likelihood estimate of . This was not the shortest of journeys, but it is interesting to see how the two concepts are related. Indeed, it sort of makes intuitive sense to think that minimizing the distance between the true and approximated distribution is best done through maximum likelihood estimation, which is a technique used to find the parameter of the distribution that best describes given data. I personally find little derivations and proofs like these to be quite interesting, which is why I plan on doing more posts on the mathematics of deep learning and its related concepts in the future.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
PyTorch Tensor Basics,"This is a very quick post in which I familiarize myself with basic tensor operations in PyTorch while also documenting and clarifying details that initially confused me. As you may realize, some of these points of confusion are rather minute details, while others concern important core operations that are commonly used. This document may grow as I start to use PyTorch more extensively for training or model implementation. Let’s get started. There appear to be two ways of specifying the size of a tensor. Using  as an example, let’s consider the difference between and It confused me how the two yielded identical results. Indeed, we can even verify that the two tensors are identical via I thought different behaviors would be expected if I passed in more dimensions, plus some additional arguments like , but this was not true. The conclusion of this analysis is that the two ways of specifying the size of a tensor are exactly identical. However, one note of caution is that NumPy is more opinionated than PyTorch and exclusively favors the tuple approach over the unpacked one. The conclusion of this analysis is that either approach is fine; it is perhaps a good idea to stick to one convention and stay consistent with that coding style throughout. Resizing or reshaping a tensor is an incredibly important tensor operation that is used all the time. The interesting thing is that there seems to be many ways of achieving the same behavior.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
BLEU from scratch,"Let’s see if the simple precision metric is able to capture this intuition. And indeed that seems to be the case! However, the simple precision-based metric has some huge problems. As an extreme example, consider the following  candidate translation. Obviously,  is a horrible translation, but the simple precision metric fails to flag it. This is because precision simply involves checking whether a hit occurs or not: it does not check for repeated bag of words. Hence, the original authors of BLEU introduces modified precision as a solution, which uses clipped counts. The gist of it is that, if some n-gram is repeated many times, we clip its count through the following formula: Here,  refers to the number of hits we assign to a certain n-gram. We sum this value over all distinct n-grams in the candidate sentence. Note that the distinction requirement effectively weeds out repetitive translations such as  we looked at earlier.  refers to the number of occurrences of a n-gram in the candidate sentence. For example, in , the unigram  appears 13 times, and so . This value, however, is clipped by , which is the maximum number of occurrence of that n-gram in any one of the reference sentences. In other words, for each reference, we count the number of occurrence of that n-gram and take the maximum value among them. This can seem very confusing, but hopefully it’s clearer once you read the code. Here is my implementation using . Notice that we use a  in order to remove redundancies.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Fisher Score and Information,"We square that quantity to prevent negative values from canceling out positive ones. Covariance is just an extension of this concept applied to a comparison of two random variables instead of one. Here, we consider how two variables move in tandem. And the variance-covariance matrix is simply a matrix that contains information on the covariance of multiple random variables in a neat, compact matrix form. A closed-form expression for the covariance matrix  given a random vector , which follows immediately from aforementioned definitions and some linear algebra, looks as follows: Enough of the prologue and review, now we’re ready to start talking about Fisher. The information matrix is defined as the covariance matrix of the score function as a random vector. Concretely, Note that the 0’s follow straight from the earlier observation that . Intuitively, Fisher’s information gives us an estimate of how certain we are about the estimate of the parameter . This can be seen by recognizing the apparent similarity between the definition of the covariance matrix we have defined above and the definition of Fisher’s information. In fact, the variance of the parameter  is explained by the inverse of Fisher’s information matrix, and this concept is known as the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound. For the purposes of this post, I won’t get deep into what CRLB is, but there are interesting connections we can make between Fisher’s information, CRLB, and the likelihood, which we will get into later.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"If there is one thing that the field of statistics wouldn’t be complete without, it’s probably normal distributions, otherwise referred to as “the bell curve.” The normal distribution was discovered and studied extensively by Carl Friedrich Gauss, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution. We have seen Gaussian distributions before in this blog, specifically on this post on likelihood and probability. However, normal distribution was introduced merely as an example back then. Today, we will put the Gaussian distribution on stage under undivided spotlight. Of course, it is impossible to cover everything about this topic, but it is my goal to use the mathematics we know to derive and understand this distribution in greater detail. Also, it’s just helpful to brush up on some multivariable calculus in a while. Let’s start with the simplest case, the univariate Gaussian distribution. The “univariate” part is just a fancier way of saying that we will dealing be dealing with one-dimensional random variables, i.e. the distribution is going to be plotted on a two-dimensional  plane. We make this seemingly trivial distinction to distinguish it from the multivariate Gaussian, which can be plotted on three-dimensional space or beyond. We’ll take a look at the multivariate normal distribution in a later section. For now, let’s derive the univariate case.

The Gibbs Sampler,"The full result is available on Wikipedia, but it’s always more interesting and rewarding to derive these results ourselves. But in this section, we will assume that we already know the final result of the derivation and use the formula for now. Note that the two functions are symmetrical, which is expected given that this is a bivariate distribution. These functions simulate a conditional distribution, where given a value of one random variable, we can sample the value of the other. This is the core mechanism by which we will be sampling from the joint probability distribution using the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Let’s initialize the parameters for the distribution and test the sampler. Great! This works as expected. For the purposes of demonstrating the implications of burn-in, let’s define discard the first 100 values that were sampled. Below is the plot of the final resulting distribution based on sampled values using the Gibbs sampler. The result is what we would expect: a bivariate Gaussian.  And this is what we end up with if we sample directly from the bivariate Gaussian instead of using the Gibbs sampler. Note that we can do this only because we chose a deliberately simple example; in many other contexts, this would certainly not be the case (if we could sample from a distribution directly, why use the Gibbs sampler in the first place?). Notice the similarity between the result achieved by sampling from the Gibbs sampler and the result produced from direct sampling as shown below.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"So far, we’ve looked at the univariate Gaussian, which involved only one random variable . However, what if the random variable in question is a vector that contains multiple random variables? It is not difficult to see that answering this question requires us to think in terms of matrices, which is the go-to method of packaging multiple numbers into neat boxes, known as matrices. Instead of deriving the probability distribution for the multivariate Gaussian from scratch as we did for the univariate case, we’ll build on top of the equation for the univariate Gaussian to provide an intuitive explanation for the multivariate case. In a previous post on linear regression, we took a look at matrix calculus to cover basic concepts such as the gradient. We established some rough intuition by associating various matrix calculus operations and their single-variable calculus analogues. Let’s try to use this intuition as a pivot point to extend the univariate Gaussian model to the multivariate Gaussian. For readability sake, here is the univariate model we have derived earlier. Examining (7), the first observation we might make is that  is no longer a coherent expression in the multivariable context. The fix to this is extremely simple: recall that in vector world.

Word2vec from Scratch,"However, the good news is that we have already derived the equation for backpropagation given a softmax layer with cross entropy loss in this post, where we built a neural network from scratch. The conclusion of the lengthy derivation was ultimately that given our model Since we know the error, we can now backpropagate it throughout the entire network, recalling basic principles of matrix calculus. If backprop is still confusing to you due to all the tranposes going on, one pro-tip is to think in terms of dimensions. After all, the dimension of the gradient must equal to the dimension of the original matrix. With that in mind, let’s implement the backpropagation function. To keep a log of the value of the error throughout the backpropagation process, I decided to make the final return value of  to be the cross entropy loss between the prediction and the target labels. The cross entropy loss function can easily be implemented as follows. Now we’re ready to train and test the model! As we only have a small number of training data—coupled with the fact that the backpropagation algorithm is simple batch gradient descent—let’s just iterate for 50 epochs. While training, we will be caching the value of the cross entropy error function in a  list. We can then plot this result to get a better sense of whether the training worked properly.

Because DL libraries make it extremely easy to declare and train LSTM networks, it’s often easy to gloss over what actually happens under the hood. However, there is certainly merit to dissecting and trying to understand the inner-working of DL models like LSTM cells, which offer a fascinating way of understanding the notion of memory.

"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","The link between the Poisson and Gamma distribution, then, is conveniently established by the fact that the time of the th arrival is lesser than  if more than  events happen within the time interval . This proposition can be expressed as an identity in the following form. Notice that the left-hand side is a cumulative distribution function of the Gamma distribution expressed in terms of . Given the derivative relationship between the CDF and PDF, we can obtain the probability distribution function of Gamma by deriving the right-hand side sigma expression with respect to . After some thinking, we can convince ourselves that unraveling the sigma results in a chain reaction wherein adjacent terms nicely cancel one another, ultimately collapsing into a single term, which also happens to be the first term of the expression: Recalling that , we can rewrite the expression as follows: Notice the structural identity between the form we have derived and the equation of the Gamma distribution function introduced above, with parameters , , and . In the language of Poisson, these variables translate to , , and , respectively. To develop and intuition of the Gamma distribution, let’s quickly plot the function. If we determine the values for the parameters  and , the term  reduces to some constant, say , allowing us to reduce the PDF into the following form: This simplified expression reveals the underlying structure behind the Gamma distribution: a fight for dominance between two terms, one that grows polynomially and the other that decays exponentially.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Using the chain rule in reverse, we get We can consider there to be 1 in the integrand and continue our calculation. The result: From (4), we can express  in terms of : After applying the substitution, now our probability density function looks as follows: To figure out what  is, let’s try to find the variance of , since we already know that the variance should be equal to . In other words, from the definition of variance, we know that Using (5), we get We can use integration by parts to evaluate this integral. This integral seems complicated, but if we take a closer look, we can see that there is a lot of room for simplification. First, because the rate of decay of an exponential function is faster than the rate of increase of a first-order polynomial, the first term converges to zero.

Notice that I’ve used the  PyTorch API instead of using class-based models. In this particular instance, we won’t have a complicated forward method, so the sequential API will suffice. Next, we create the generator. It is also a sequential model, inside of which are stacks of linear layers with ReLU activations. Before we jump into training, let’s move these networks to the  object we’ve created earlier. The interesting part starts here. Notice that we have different optimizers for the discriminator and the generator. This is expected, since we are going to be training two different networks in a different manner. Before we get into the details of training, here is a simple utility function in which we zero the gradients for both the generator and the discriminator. We want the discriminator to be able to distinguish real from fake images. Therefore, the discriminator will have a combined loss: the loss that comes from falsely identifying real images as fake, and the loss that comes from confusing fake, generated images as real ones. For the generator, the loss is actually dependent upon the classifier: the loss comes from the classifier correctly identifying generated images as fake.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"We can see this in practice by reapplying Bayes’ theorem with updated information, as shown below: We see that the value of the conditional probability has indeed increased, lending credence to the idea that the man is sick. Like this, Like this, Bayes’ theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to calculate conditional probabilities and to update them continuously through repeated trials. From a Bayesian perspective, we begin with some expectation, or prior probability, that an event will occur. We then update this prior probability by computing conditional probabilities with new information obtained for each trial, the result of which yields a posterior probability. This posterior probability can then be used as a new prior probability for subsequent analysis. In this light, Bayesian statistics offers a new way to compute new information and update our beliefs about an event in probabilistic terms. Bayesian inference is nothing more than an extension of Bayes’ theorem. The biggest difference between the two is that Bayesian inference mainly deals with probability distributions instead of point probabilities. The case of the potential patient we analyzed above was a simple yet illuminating example, but it was limiting in that we assumed all parameters to be simple constants, such as  for test accuracy and  for false positive frequency. In reality, most statistical estimates exist as probability distributions since there are limitations to our ability to measure and survey data from the population.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

For example, the snippet below shows how we can reshape  into a  tensor. One very important detail, however, is that this operation is not in-place. In other words, if we check the size of  again, you will realize that it is still a  tensor, as was originally initialized. To change  itself, we could do Or even better, we can use , which is an in-place operation by design. Notice that, unlike when we called ,  changes the tensor itself, in-place. In older versions of PyTorch,  existed as a non in-place operator. However, in newer versions of PyTorch, this is no longer the case, and PyTorch will complain with an informative deprecation error message. Note that  is not an in-place operator, meaning its behavior will largely be identical to that of . PyTorch keeps an internal convention when it comes to differentiating between in-place and copy operations. Namely, functions that end with a  are in-place operators.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"At a glance, this distribution resembles the binomial distribution we looked at earlier, and indeed that is no coincidence: the Poisson distribution is essentially a special case of binomial distributions whereby the number of trials is literally pushed to the limit. As stated earlier, the binomial distribution can be considered as a very rough approximation of the Poisson distribution, and the accuracy of approximation would be expected to increase as  increases. So let me ask the question again: how lucky was I yesterday? The probability distribution function of the Poisson distribution tells us that  can be calculated through the following equation: The result given by the Poisson distribution is somewhat larger than that derived from the binomial distribution, which was . This discrepancy notwithstanding, the fact that I had a very lucky day yesterday does not change: I would have days like these once every 100 days, and those days surely don’t come often. But to really calculate how lucky I get for the next 18 months of my life in the military, we need to do a bit more: we need to also take into account the fact that receiving lesser than 5 calls on a shift also constitutes a lucky day.

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This network pretty much follows the standard vanilla convolutional neural network model, which typically involves stacking convolution, batch normalization, and pooling layers on top of each other.

The  argument ensures that the the feature maps are not downsized too quickly due to repeated applications of convolution and pooling. The  layer simply normalizes the tensor returned from the previous layer. There are ongoing research as to what effect batch normalization has on neural networks, but the general consensus is that it helps the model learn more quickly and efficiently.

The corpus simply refers to the entire set of words in the dataset. Specifically for our purposes, the corpus will be a dictionary whose keys are the words and values are an ordinal index. Another way to think about the corpus in this context is to consider it as a word-to-index mapping. We will be using the indices to represent each word in the tf, idf, and tf-idf vectors later on in the tutorial. Because we have a very simple example, our corpus only contains 9 words. This also means that our tf-idf vectors for each document will also be a list of length 9. Thus it isn’t difficult to see how tf-idf vectorization can result in extremely high-dimensional matrices, which is why we often apply techniques such as lemmatization or PCA on the final result. Also note that published modules use sparse representations to minimize computational load, as we will later see with scikit-learn.

Now, we can finally glue the pieces together to understand (4): we enforce forgetfulness, then supply the cell state with new information. This is now the updated cell state, which gets passed onto the next sequence as new inputs are fed into the LSTM. So far, we have only looked at the recurrent features of LSTM; in other words, how it uses information from the past to update its knowledge in the present at time . However, we haven’t yet discussed the most important part of any neural network: generating output. Obviously, all that hassle of forgetting and updating the cell state would be utterly meaningless if the cell state is not used to generate output. The whole purpose of maintaining a cell state, therefore, is to imitate long and short-term memory of the brain to generate some output.

Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if  is close to 1, since . This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach. The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above. Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped. Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"At the Yongsan Provost Marshall Office, I receive a wide variety of calls during my shift. Some of them are part of routine communications, such as gate checks or facility operation checks. Others are more spontaneous; fire alarm reports come in from time to time, along with calls from the Korean National Police about intoxicated soldiers who get involved in mutual assault or misdemeanors of the likes. Once, I got a call from the American Red Cross about a suicidal attempt of a soldier off post. All combined, I typically find myself answering about ten to fifteen calls per shift. But yesterday was a special day, a good one indeed, because I received only five calls in total. This not only meant that USAG-Yongsan was safe and sound, but also that I had a relatively light workload. On other days when lawlessness prevails over order, the PMO quickly descends into chaos—patrols get dispatched, the desk sergeant files mountains of paperwork, and I find myself responding to countless phone calls while relaying relevant information to senior officials, first sergeants, and the Korean National Police. So yesterday got me thinking: what is the probability that I get only five calls within a time frame of eight hours, given some estimate of the average number of calls received by the PMO, say 12?

Gamma and Zeta,"This means that , using which we can establish the following: With some algebraic implications, we end up with Dividing both sides by , we get All the magic happens when we cast a summation on the entire expression: Notice that now we have the Riemann zeta function on the left hand side. All we have to do is to clean up what is on the right. As it stands, the integral is not particularly tractable; however, we can swap the integral and the summation expression to make progress. I still haven’t figured out the details of when this swapping is possible, which has to do with absolute divergence, but I will be blogging about it in the future once I have a solid grasp of it, as promised before. The expression in the parentheses is just a simple sum of geometric series, which we know how to calculate. Therefore, we obtain To make this integral look more nicer into a form known as the Bose integral, let’s multiply both the numerator and the denominator by . After some cosmetic simplifications, we end up with Putting everything together, now we have derived a nice expression that places both the Riemann zeta and the Gamma functions together: Or, alternatively, a definition of the Riemann zeta in terms of the Gamma: And indeed, with (13), we can evaluate the Riemann zeta function at non-integer points as well.

MLE and KL Divergence,"d, which is the assumption that we make to build models such as naïve Bayes, and so on. For now, it suffices to clarify that the goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the optimal parameter of a distribution that best captures some given data. KL divergence is a concept that arises from the field of information theory that is also heavily applied in statistics and machine learning. KL divergence is particularly useful because it can be used to measure the dissimilarity between to probability distributions. The familiar equation for KL divergence goes as follows: In Bayesian terms, KL divergence might be used to compare the prior and the posterior distribution, where  represents the posterior and , the prior. In machine learning,  is often the true distribution which we seek to model, and  is the approximation of that true distribution, which is also the prediction generated by the model. Note that KL divergence is not a true measure of distance, since it is asymmetric. In other words, The focus of this post is obviously not on distance metrics, and I plan on writing a separate post devoted to this topic. But as a preview of what is to come, here is an appetizer to get you interested. An alternative to KL divergence that satisfies the condition of symmetry is the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, which is defined as follows: where One can intuit JSD as being a measurement that somewhat averages the two asymmetric quantities of KL divergence.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Gaussian Process Regression,"I think this is the most fascinating part about GPs—as we will see later on, GPs do not require us to specify any function or model to fit the data. Instead, all we need to do is to identify the mean and covariance of a multivariate Gaussian that defines the posterior of the GP. All of this sounds too good be true—how can a single multivariate Gaussian distribution be enough for what could potentially be a high-dimensional, complicated regression problem? Let’s discuss some mathematical ideas that enable GP to be so powerful. Gaussians are essentially a black hole of distributions: once a Gaussian, always a Gaussian. For example, we know from a previous post on Gibbs sampling that the conditional of a multivariate Gaussian is also Gaussian. given the setup that and And of course, the marginal of a multivariate Gaussian also produces another Gaussian. This marginalization property can be understood both intuitively by thinking about the implications of viewing the mean and covariance as vectors and matrices, or by taking a direct integral: Lastly and most importantly, we also saw in the post on Bayesian linear regression that the product of two Gaussians is also Gaussian. Like this, a distribution that is Gaussian most likely stays Gaussian, withstanding such operations as marginalization, multiplication, or conditioning. This is a powerful property that we can use to motivate the “Gaussian-ness” behind GP. As stated earlier, GP is non-parametric.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"If you are wondering how (1) translates to the return statement, then the following equation might resolve your curiosity. This is the promised elaboration on the relationship between log variance and standard deviation: Therefore, multiplying 0.5 is just a simple algebraic manipulation to morph log variance to standard deviation. The reason why we use log variance instead of just variance or standard deviation is to ensure numerical stability in computation. Now that this part has been cleared, let’s start stacking away layers! Just like the autoencoder, VAEs are composed of two discrete components: the encoder and the decoder. Here, we take a look at the first piece of the puzzle, the encoder network. There are several things to note about this model. First, I decided to use a  loop to simplify the process of stacking layers. Instead of repeating the same code over multiple lines, I found this approach to be more succinct and concise. Second, we define a custom layer at the end, shown as , that uses the  function we defined earlier. This is the final key that enables us to build an encoder model that receives as input a 28-by-28 image, then output a two-dimensional latent vector representation of that image to pass onto the decoder network. Below is the summary of what our model looks like. Note that the model outputs a total of three quantities: , , and .",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"This is why VAEs are considered to be generative models: if we feed the VAE some two-dimensional vector living in the latent space, it will spit out a digit. Whether or not that digit appears convincing depends on the random vector the decoder was provided as input: if the vector is close to the learned mean, , then the result will be convincing; if not, we might see a confusing blob of black and white. Let’s see what exactly is going on in the fuzzy region of the image, because that is apparently where all the digits mingle together and seem indistinguishable from one another. Put differently, if we vary the random vector little by little across that region, we will be able to see how the digit slowly morphs into another number.  How cool is that? We were able to get a VAE to show us how one digit can shift across a certain domain of the latent space. This is one of the many cool things we can do with a generative model like a variational autoencoder. In this post, we took a deep dive into the math behind variational autoencoders. It was a long journey, but definitely worth it because it exposed us to many core concepts in deep learning and statistics.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a famous problem in computer science. The problem might be summarized as follows: imagine you are a salesperson who needs to visit some number of cities. Because you want to minimize costs spent on traveling (or maybe you’re just lazy like I am), you want to find out the most efficient route, one that will require the least amount of traveling. You are given a coordinate of the cities to visit on a map. How can you find the optimal route? The most obvious solution would be the brute force method, where you consider all the different possibilities, calculate the estimated distance for each, and choose the one that is the shortest path. While this is a definite way to solve TSP, the issue with this approach is that it requires a lot of compute—the runtime of this brute force algorithm would be , which is just utterly terrible. In this post, we will consider a more interesting way to approach TSP: genetic algorithms. As the name implies, genetic algorithms somewhat simulate an evolutionary process, in which the principle of the survival of the fittest ensures that only the best genes will have survived after some iteration of evolutionary cycles across a number of generations. Genetic algorithms can be considered as a sort of randomized algorithm where we use random sampling to ensure that we probe the entire search space while trying to find the optimal solution.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"This is all there is to it—in fact, the formula for tf-idf can simply be expressed as where  denotes a single term; , a singe document, and , a collection of documents. So simply put, tf-idf is simply a product of the term frequency, denoted above as , and inverse document frequency, . All there is left, then, is to figure out what term frequency and inverse document frequency are. Without much explanation, you can probably guess what term frequency is: it simply indicates how frequently a word appeared in a given document. For example, if there were a total of 3 distinct words in a document (very short, I know), then each of the three words would have a tf score of . Put differently, the sum of the tf vector for each document should sum to one. The definition of a tf score might be thus expressed as where the denominator denotes the count of all occurrences of the term  in document , and the numerator represents the total number of terms in the document. Roughly speaking, inverse document frequency is simply the reciprocal of document frequency. Therefore, it suffices to show what document frequency is, since idf would immediately follow from df. Before getting into the formula, I think it’s instructive to consider the motivation behind tf-idf, and in particular what role idf plays in the final score.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"But if our LSTM network only keeps forgetting, obviously this is going to be problematic. Instead, we also want to update the cell state using the new input values. Let’s take a look at the cell state equation again: Previously when discussing the forget gate, we focused only on the first term. Taking a look at the second term, we note that the term is adding some value to the cell state that has been updated to forget information. It only makes sense, then, for the second term to perform the information update sequence. But to understand the second term, we need to take a look at two other equations: (2) is another forward pass involving concatenation, much like we saw in (1) with . The only difference is that, instead of forgetting,  is meant to simulate an update of the cell state. In some LSTM variants,  is simply replaced with , in which case the cell state update would be rewritten as However, we will stick to the convention that uses  instead of the simpler variant as shown in (4-2).

Moments in Statistics,"In the end, both (12) and (13) are pointing at the same quantity, namely the third moment of the exponential distribution. Perhaps the complexity of calculating either quantity is similar, and the question might just boil down to a matter of preference. However, this example shows that the MGF is a robust method of calculating moments of a distribution, and even more, potentially less computationally expensive than using the brute force method to directly calculate expected values. This was a short post on moments and moment generating functions. Moments was one of these terms that I had come across on Wikipedia or math stackexchange posts, but never had a chance to figure out. Hopefully, this post gave you some intuition behind the notion of moments, as well as how moment generating functions can be used to compute useful properties that explain a distribution.

PyTorch Tensor Basics,"If we apply  to , we essentially add a new dimension to the 0-th position of ’s shape.

Yet they are also operations that I often had trouble imagining in my head, largely because concatenation can happen along many axes or dimensions. In this section, let’s solidify our understanding of what concatenation really achieves with some dummy examples. With a basic example, we can quickly verify that each tensor is a three-dimensional tensor whose individual elements are two-dimensional tensors of shape . Now, let’s perform the first concatenation along the 0-th dimension, or the batch dimension. We can verify that the concatenation occurred along the 0-th dimension by checking the shape of the resulting tensor.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"We see that accuracy spikes up on the first 20- epochs or so and quite quickly converges to about 90 percent. Past a certain threshold, the model seems to hover consistently at around the high 90s range, but accuracy still continues to increase ever so slightly with each epoch, though not as quickly as before. If we set the learning rate  to a smaller number, we would expect the model to take a lot longer to tune, and indeed this seems to be true:  With a much smaller learning rate, the model seems to struggle to achieve high accuracy. However, although there are a lot of uneven spikes, the model still manages to reach a pretty high accuracy score by 200 epochs. This tells us that the success of model training depends a lot on how we set the learning rate; setting an excessively high value for the learning rate might result in overshooting, while a low learning rate might prevent the model from quickly learning from the data and making meaningful progress. Accuracy helps us intuitively understand how well our model is doing, but recall that the main objective of gradient descent is not to maximize accuracy, but to minimize the cross entropy loss function. Therefore, perhaps it makes more sense to evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model by plotting cross entropy. Presented below is a simple function that plots epoch versus cross entropy given a list of learning rates, . Let’s plot cross entropy loss for three different values of : 0.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Bayesian Linear Regression,"We might also notice that the sampled regression lines seem to stay below the true regression line for smaller values of . This is because we have more samples beneath the true regression line that we have above it. Bayesian linear regression is able to account for such variations in data and uncertainty, which is a huge advantage over the simple MLE linear regression method. The true power of Bayesian linear regression might be summarized as follows: instead of returning just a single line using the MLE weight estimate of data, Bayesian linear regression models the entire data set to create a distribution of linear functions so to speak, allowing us to sample from that distribution to obtain sample linear regression lines. This is an approach that makes much more sense, since it allows us to take into account the uncertainty in our linear regression estimate. The reason why the normal equation method is unable to capture this uncertainty is that—as you might recall from the derivation of the formula for vanilla linear regression—the tools we used did not involve any probabilistic modeling. Recall that we used only linear algebra and matrix calculus to derive the model for vanilla linear regression. Bayesian linear regression is more complicated in that it involves computations with probability density functions, but the end result is of course more rewarding. That’s it for today!

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Last but not least, let’s visualize the training scheme of all four models to take a identify any possible signs of convergence and overfitting, if any. To do that, we will be using the  function shown below. The dense feed-forward network seems to have a very linear pattern. One immediate pattern we see is that the model seems to be overfitting right away, since the testing accuracy decreases with each epoch while the training accuracy increases. This is certainly not a good sign; in the best case scenario, we want to see that training and testing labels moving in the same direction. Perhaps this is the biggest indication that a simple feed forward network is a suboptimal model choice in the context of this problem.  The graphs for the  model seems a lot better. At the very least, we see the training and test labels moving in unison: the accuracy increases with each epoch, while the loss slowly decreases. However, we do see some overfitting happening at the last two epochs or so. Specifically, note that cross entropy loss for the testing data seems to pick up an incrementing pattern past the seventh epoch. This observation suggests that we need to configure the model differently, presumably by decreasing the number of tunable parameters.  Next comes the winner of the day, the LSTM network. An interesting point to note about the learning curve of this model is that the test data accuracy and loss seem to stay roughly stagnant despite the progression of epochs.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"Although I’ve been able to automate some portion of the blog workflow, there’s always been a challenging part that I wanted to further automate myself using deep learning: automatic tagging and categorization.

Although I sometimes create new tags or categories if existing ones seem unfit, I only deal with a limited number of topics on this blog, which is why I’ve always thought that some form of supervised learning be able to automate the process by at least generating some possible tags for me. I’m currently in the process of preparing the data (my previous blog posts) and building a simple NLP document classification model for the job. However, NLP is a field that I’m admittedly not well-acquainted with, not to mention the fact that I’ve not bee posting a lot about deep learning implementations for a while now. So in today’s short post, I decided to write about tf-idf vectorization, which is a very simple yet powerful technique that is often used in routine tasks like document classification, where SOTA models aren’t really required.

Each value of the dictionary below encodes the architecture information for each model. The integer elements represents the out channel of each layer.  represents a max pool layer. You will quickly see that the dictionary is just a simple representation of the tabular information above. Now it’s time to build the class that, given some architecture encoding as shown above, can produce a PyTorch model. The basic idea behind this is that we can make use of iteration to loop through each element of the model architecture in list encoding and stack convolutional layers to form a sub-unit of the network.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The idea is that we want to get a dot product of the weight vector and the data vector, then plug the resulting value into the sigmoid function to get some value between 0 and 1. The  function shown below exactly performs this task, with the added caveat that it returns a label prediction when the boolean argument  is set to ; a raw sigmoid output when the same is set to . Let’s perform a quick sanity check by using some dummy weight vector. Using the coefficients in the  list, we can generate predictions for each observation in the . The actual class information is stored in the  list. The dummy coefficients are poorly optimized, which is why the predicted class labels do not align well with the actual class labels. This tells us that more tuning is required to update the coefficients and build a robust logistic regression model. But how exactly can we tune our model? Simply eyeballing the actual and predicted labels of our data is probably not going to help us much. To optimize the coefficients to best fit our data, we need to construct some loss function—that is, a function that describes how badly our model is performing. Then, we can optimize the weights of our model by minimizing that loss function, which would mean that our model gradually makes better predictions with each round of optimization. If you recall the previous post on entropy, you will remember that we discussed a concept called cross entropy.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Let’s cut to the chase: RNNs emulate memory by using the output from the previous sequence as an input to the next. Perhaps writing this down in matrix notation might give you a better idea of what the statement above means. Here is one way we might implement a very simple recurrent neural network. If the word “recursion” pops up into your mind, then you are on the right track. Notice that in calculating , the output of the current sequence, the output of the previous sequence,  is used. By using the output of the previous sequence, the recurrent neural network is able to “remember” some of the information that was produced by the previous input. Granted, this is not exactly what memory is or how it works in the strictest sense, but we can see how some information from the previous input is trickling down to affect the computation of the current sequence of input data. Note that I used  for the example, but we can just about use any other activation function. Here is one way we might implement this in Python. Although not necessary, I decided to opt for a class-based implementation to make things look tight and nicer. Let’s create a  class object to see that everything works properly. There is really not much point in seeing the output because the calculations are going to be based off of randomly generated data and randomly created weights, but perhaps there is something to be learned from the dimensionality of input and output data.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The Math Behind GANs,"This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence: The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function , we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words,  and  should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator  is thus one that which is able to mimic  to model a compelling model distribution . In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless. I hope you enjoyed reading this post. In the next post, I plan to explore the concept of Fisher information and the Fisher matrix. It is going to be another math-heavy ride with gradients and Hessians, so keep you belts fastened!.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Complex Fibonacci,"The takeaway from the code snippet is that holds, regardless of whether or not  is a non-negative integer. Indeed, Binet’s formula gives us what we might refer to as the interpolation of the fibonacci sequence, in this case extended along the real number line. A corollary of the real number interpolation of the fibonacci sequence via Binet’s formula is that now we can effectively plot the complex fibonacci numbers on the Cartesian plane. Because  can be continuous, we would expect some graph to appear, where the -axis represents real numbers, and , the imaginary. This requires a bit of a hack though; note that the result of Binet’s formula is a complex number, or a two-dimensional data point. The input to the function is just a one-dimensional real number. Therefore, we need a way of representing a map from a one-dimensional real number line to a two-dimensional complex plane. This is sort of tricky if you think about it: the normal two-dimensional plane as we know it can only represent a mapping from the -axis to the -axis—in other words, a transformation from one-dimensional space to another one-dimensional space. A three-dimensional -coordinate system, on the other hand, represents a transformation from a two-dimensional space, represented by  and , to another one-dimensional space, namely . We aren’t used to going to other way around, where a one-dimensional space is mapped to a two-dimensional space, as is the case here.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","We can further break this expression down by taking note of the fact that the norm of a vector can be expressed as a product of the vector and its transpose, and that  as established in the previous section of this post. Putting these together, Using distribution, we can simplify the above expression as follows: It’s time to take the gradient of the error function, the matrix calculus analogue of taking the derivative. Now is precisely the time when the propositions (4) and (5) we explored earlier will come in handy. In fact, observe that first term in (6) corresponds to case (5); the second term, case (4). The last term can be ignored because it is a scalar term composed of , which means that it will not impact the calculation of the gradient, much like how constants are eliminated during derivation in single-variable calculus. Now, all we have to do is to set the expression above to zero, just like we would do in single variable calculus with some optimization problem. There might be those of you wondering how we can be certain that setting this expression to zero would yield the minimum instead of the maximum. Answering this question requires a bit more math beyond what we have covered here, but to provide a short preview, it turns out that our error function, defined as  is a positive definite matrix, which guarantees that the critical point we find by calculating the gradient gives us a minimum instead of a maximum.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
My First GAN,"For this tutorial, we will be using images of ships, which are labeled as 8. So let’s go ahead and specify that. We see that  contains 6000 images, which is more than enough to start training our GAN. To train the GAN, we will define a  function. Essentially, this function creates binary labels for real and fake images. Recall that the goal of the discriminator is to successfully discern generated images from real ones. Also recall that to create generated images, the generator needs to sample from a latent dimension. In other words, training will consist of the following steps: These high level abstractions are what  implements behind the scenes. There are several subtleties that deserve our attention. First, we fade out the labels ever so slightly to expedite the training process. These are little magic tricks that people have found to work well on GAN training. While I’m not entirely sure about the underlying principle, it most likely comes from the fact that having a smooth manifold is conducive to the training of a neural network. Second, coercing a true label on the GAN essentially trains the generator. Note that we never explicitly address the generator in the function; instead, we only train the discriminator. By coercing a true label on the GAN, we are effectively forcing the generator to produce more compelling images, and penalizing it when it fails to do so. Personally, I find this part to be the genius and beauty of training GANs.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"” This simply means that the progress of the game depends only on the players’ current positions, not where they were or how they got there. A player might have ended up where they are by taking a ladder or by performing a series of regular dice rolls. In the end, however, all that matters is that the players eventually hit the hundredth cell. To perform a Markov chain analysis on the Chutes and Ladders game, it is first necessary to convert the information presented on the board as a stochastic matrix. How would we go about this process? Let’s assume that we start the game at the th cell by rolling a dice. There are six possible events, each with probability of . More specifically, we can end up at the index numbers 38, 2, 3, 14, 5, or 6. In other words, at position 0, where  and  denote the current and next position of the player on the game board, respectively. We can make the same deductions for other cases where . We are thus able to construct a 101-by-101 matrix representing the transition probabilities of our Chutes and Ladders system, where each column represents the system at a different state, i.e. the th entry of the th column vector represents the probabilities of moving from cell  to cell .

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This visualization will help us see whether our model is actually learning with each epoch, and whether or not overfitting is occurring at any point in training. The last piece of the puzzle we need is the  function. This function is essentially wraps all the functions we have created previously, first by loading the data, training using that data, building a model, training a model, and calling on the  function to provide a visualization of the model’s learning curve. One minor tweak I used to spice up this function is the , which basically creates more images for the neural network to train on by slightly modifying existing images in the training set. These modifications involve shifting, zooming, and flipping. When we don’t have enough data to train our model on, using the  can be useful. Finally, let’s see how well our model performs!  The result shows that the model has learned decently well, with testing accuracy of approximately 80 percent. This is not the best result, but it is certainly not bad, especially given the fact that the images in the dataset, as we have seen above, are very pixelated and sometimes difficult for even humans to decipher and categorize. That’s all for today. It’s fascinating to see how CNNs are capable of perceiving images and categorizing them after appropriate training.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"Welcome to part three of the “from scratch” series where we implement machine learning models from the ground up. The model we will implement today, called the naive Bayes classifier, is an interesting model that nicely builds on top of the Bayesian mindset we developed in the previous post on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Much like the logistic regression model, naive Bayes can be used to solve classification tasks, as opposed to regression in which case the goal is to predict a continuous variable. The main difference between logistic regression and naive Bayes is that naive Bayes is built on a probabilistic model instead of an optimization model such as graident descent. Hence, implementing naive Bayes is somewhat easier from a programming point of view. Enough of the prologue, let’s cut to the chase. To understand naive Bayes, we need not look further than Bayes’s theorem, which is probably the single most referenced theorem on this blog so far. I won’t explain this much since we have already seen it so many times, but presented below is the familar formula for reference and readability’s sake. Very standard, perhaps with the exception of some minor notation. Here,  refers to a single instance, represented as a vector with  entries; , the corresponding label or class for that instance.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","These past few weeks, I’ve been powering through PyTorch notebooks and tutorials, mostly because I enjoyed the PyTorch API so much and found so many of it useful and intuitive. Well, the problem was that I ended up writing something like ten notebooks without ever publishing them on this blog. So really, I’m going over some old notebooks I’ve coded out more than a month ago to finally make it live. That’s enough excuses, let’s get into the basics of PyTorch modeling in this notebook with the CIFAR10 dataset and some basic CNNs. The setup is pretty simple here. We import some modules and functions from PyTorch, as well as  to be able to show some basic training plots. One thing I have noticed is that a lot of people do something like which I personally don’t really get, because you can easily just do If you ask me, I think the latter is more elegant and less cluttered (after all, we don’t have to repeat  twice). I don’t think the two import statements are functionally different, but if I do figure out any differences, I will make sure to update future notebooks. One of the many nice things about PyTorch is the clean, intuitive API. PyTorch comes with good GPU support, and one of the main ways through which this can be done is by creating a  object.

Word2vec from Scratch,"This aligns with the behavior we want, since we want the predicted probability to be as close to 1 as possible. So let’s summarize the entire process a little bit. First, embeddings are simply the rows of the first weight matrix, denoted as . Through training and backpropgation, we adjust the weights of , along with the weight matrix in the second layer, denoted as , using cross entropy loss. Overall, our model takes on the following structure: where  is the matrix contains the prediction probability vectors. With this in mind, let’s actual start building and train our model. Let’s start implement this model in code. The implementation we took here is extremely similar to the approach we took in this post. For an in-depth review of backpropagation derivation with matrix calculus, I highly recommend that you check out the linked post. The representation we will use for the model is a Python dictionary, whose values are the weight matrices and keys, the name with which we will refer to the weight matrices. In accordance with the nomenclature established earlier, we stick with  and  to refer to these weights. Let’s specify our model to create ten-dimensional embeddings. In other words, each token will be represented as vectors living in ten-dimensional space.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","An error term of  means that, if we halve the step size, we will also halve the error. This is best understood as a linear relationship between error and the step size. We can conduct a similar mode of analysis with backward divided difference. By symmetry, we can express  as If we rearrange (6), we end up with (2). Again, we see that backward divided difference yields linear error, or a trailing term of . Here’s where things get more interesting: in the case of center divided difference, the magnitude of the error term is , meaning that halving the step size decreases the error by four-folds. This is why center divided difference yields much more accurate approximations than forward or backward divided difference. To see this, we subtract (5) from (4), then move some terms, and divide both sides by . Notice that subtracting these two expression results in a lot of term cancellations. Dividing both sides by  yields From this result, we now know why the central divided difference method provides more accurate approximations of the derivative than do forward and backward divided difference. This is somewhat related to what we will be doing in the next section, so it’s a good intuition to have throughout when reading the rest of this article.

The Math Behind GANs,"Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible. In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is Generative Adversarial Nets by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin! GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each. To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post. The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"The returned result is not abysmal, but we clearly can do a lot better. The reason behind this spotty estimation can be checked by drawing the plot of the Monte Carlo simulation, as shown below.  As we can see, ten samples simply aren’t enough to really cover the entire area of the plane or the circle. Although we do get some points in the circle, it’s really hard to tell if the proportion of points in and out of the circle is going to be representative of the actual proportion of area between the circle and the square. Let’s push our MC algorithm to do a bit more by sampling more data points, this time with 100000 randomly generated points. As expected, with more data points, we get a better estimation of pi. Although the randomness created by the  call in our function means that this estimation will fluctuate with each execution, the value is reliably close to the actual value of , differing only by about 0.01 or less. If we draw the plot for our experiment, it is clear that our data points accurately capture the proportionality between the area of the square and the circle.  We can systematically verify that more samples tend to yield better results by graphing the magnitude of the error of our estimation plotted against the number of random samples generated.  The plot shows that, with larger sample sizes, the error quickly converges to around 0.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
MLE and KL Divergence,"We will revisit JSD in the future when we discuss the mathematics behind GANs. But for now, it suffices to know what KL divergence is and what it measures. Now that we have reviewed the essential concepts that we need, let’s get down to the proof. Let’s start with the statement of the parameter  that minimizes the KL divergence between the two distribution  and the approximate distribution : Not a lot has happened in this step, except for substituting the  expression with its definition as per (2). Observe that in the last derived expression in (4), the term  does not affect the argument of the minima, which is why it can safely be omitted to yield the following simplified expression: We can change the argument of the minima operator to the maxima given the negative sign in the expression for the expected value. To proceed further, it is necessary to resort to the Law of Large Numbers, or LLN for short. The law states that the average of samples obtained from a large number of repeated trials should be close to the expected value of that random variable. In other words, the average will approximate the expected value as more trials are performed. More formally, LLN might be stated in the following fashion. Suppose we perform an experiment involving the random variable  and repeat it  times. Then, we would obtain a set of indecent and identically distributed (i.i.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Principal Component Analysis,"It is not difficult to see that the trace of , which is a scalar in the one-dimensional case, is maximized when  is an eigenvector of  with the largest eigenvalue. Generalizing this result back to , we see that  is a matrix whose columns correspond to the eigenvectors of  in descending order. If you had prior exposure to PCA, you might know that the standard way of obtaining principal components is by calculating the covariance matrix of the data and finding its eigenvectors. Here, I attempt to present an explanation of how and why the procedure outlined in the preceding section is essentially achieving the same tasks, albeit through a different frame of thought. The unbiased sample covariance matrix is given by Of course, this is operating under the assumption that  has already been standardized such that the mean of the data is zero. You might be thinking that the formulation in (14) looks different from the one introduced previously on this post on SVD. In that particular post, I stated that covariance could be calculated as (14) and (15) certainly look different. However, under the hood, they express the same quantity.

The Exponential Family,"Normal, binomial, exponential, gamma, beta, poisson… These are just some of the many probability distributions that show up on just about any statistics textbook. Until now, I knew that there existed some connections between these distributions, such as the fact that a binomial distribution simulates multiple Bernoulli trials, or that the continuous random variable equivalent of the geometric distribution is the exponential. However, reading about the concept of the exponential family of distributions has lent me new insight, and I wish to share that renewed understanding on probability distributions through this post. In this section, we will take a look at what the exponential family of distributions is all about. We will begin by laying out a few mathematical definitions, then proceed to see examples of probability distributions that belong to the exponential family. To cut to the chase, the exponential family simply denotes a  group of probability distributions that satisfy a certain condition, namely that they can be factorized and parametrized into a  specific form, as show below: Here,  is a log noramlizing constant that ensures that the probability distribution integrates to 1. There are other alternative forms that express the same factorization. One such variant that I prefer and find more intuitive uses a simple fractional approach for normalization instead of adding complications to the exponential term. For notational convenience, I will follow the fractional normalization approach shown below throughout this post.

The Gibbs Sampler,"In this post, we will explore Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm used for sampling from probability distributions, somewhat similar to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm we discussed some time ago. MCMC has somewhat of a special meaning to me because Markov chains was one of the first topics that I wrote about here on my blog. It’s been a while since I have posted anything about math or statistics-related, and I’ll admit that I’ve been taking a brief break from these domains, instead working on some personal projects and uping my Python coding skills. This post is going to be a fun, exciting mesh of some Python and math. Without further ado, let’s get started. I remember struggling to understand Metropolis-Hastings a while back. Gibbs sampling, on the other hand, came somewhat very naturally and intuitively to me. This is not because I’ve suddenly grown intelligent over the past couple of months, but because Gibbs sampling is conceptually simpler, at least in my humble opinion. All that is necessary to understand Gibbs sampling is the notion of conditional probability distributions. We know the classic context in which MCMC comes into play in a Bayesian setting: there is some intractable distribution that we wish to sample from. Metropolis-Hastings was one simple way to go about this, and Gibbs sampling provides another method. A feature that makes Gibbs sampling unique is its restrictive context.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"In that context, a class label of 2 is not at all related to adding two data points belonging to class 1, or any arithmatic operation of that kind. To prevent our model from making such arbitrary, unhelpful connections, we convert class labels to one-hot encoded vectors. We could use external libraries such as  to invoke the  function, but instead let’s just build a function ourselves since this is a relatively simple task. Let’s test the  function on the training data. We don’t need the entire data to see that it works, so let’s slice the  array to see its first five elements. When we apply  to the data, we see that the returned result is a two-dimensional array containing one-hot encoded vectors, as intended. That’s all the data and the preprocessing we will need for now. Activation functions are important aspects of neural networks. In fact, it is what allows neural networks to model nonlinearities in data. As we will see in the next section, a neural network is essentially composed of layers and weights that can be expressed as matrix multiplications. No matter how complex a matrix may be, matrix multiplication is a linear operation, which means that is impossible to model nonlinearities. This is where activation functions kick in: by applying nonlinear transformation to layer outputs, we can make neural networks capable of modeling nonlinearities.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

I would also like to thank ritvikmath for a great beginner-friendly explanation on GMMs and Expectation Maximization, as well as fiveMinuteStats for a wonderful exposition on the intuition behind the EM algorithm. Without further ado, let’s jump right into it. The motivating idea behind GMMs is that we can model seemingly complicated distributions as a convex combination of Gaussians each defined by different parameters. One visual analogy I found particularly useful is imagining Gaussians as some sort of hill or mountain on a contour map. If we have multiple hills adjacent to one another, we can essentially model the topography of the region as a combination of Gaussians. At peaks, we would see circular contour lines, but where the hills meet, we might see different patterns, most likely circular patterns overlapping with each other. The key point here is that the combination is convex; in other words, the mixing coefficient for each Gaussian should add up to one.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways",") In our case, we love orthogonality because they are key to deriving the equation for the line of best fit through projection. To see what this means, let’s quickly assume a toy example to work with: assume we have three points,  and , as shown below.  As we can see, the three points do not form a single line. Therefore, it’s time for some regression. Let’s assume that this line is defined by . The system of equations which we will attempt to solve looks as follows: Or if you prefer the vector-matrix representation as I do, This system, remind ourselves, does not have a solution because we have geometrically observed that no straight line can pass through all three points. What we can do, however, is find a projection of the vector  onto matrix  so that we can identify a solution that is closest to , which we shall denote as . As you can see, this is where all the linear algebra kicks in. Let’s start by thinking about , the projection of  onto . After some thinking, we can convince ourselves that  is the component of  that lives within the column space of , and that  is the error component of  that lives outside the column space of .

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This is a highly intuitive restatement of the definition of conditional probability introduced above: given that event  has already occurred, conditional probability tells us the probability that event  occurs, which is then synonymous to that statement that  has occurred. By the same token, we can also define the reverse conditional probability of  given  through symmetry and substitution. Notice that the numerator stays unchanged since the operation of intersection is commutative. Now let’s develop an intuition for conditional probabilities by applying it to our example of clinical trials and the potentially affected patient. The purported accuracy of the clinical test is 90 percent, which we might express as follows, using the conditional probability notation: By the same token, we can also express the information on false positives as shown below. This conditional probability statement espouses that, given an individual who is not sick, the test returns a false positive 50 percent of the time. Conditional probability provides us with an interesting way to analyze given information. For instance, let  be the event that it rains tomorrow, and  be the event that it is cloudy at the present moment. Although we are no experts in climatology and weather forecast, common sense tells us that since with the additional piece of information that current weather conditions are cloudy, we are inclined to believe that it will likely rain tomorrow, or in the near future.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The underlying idea is that, given some data with  feature columns, we can derive a probability distribution for the label for that intance. The naive assumption that the naive Bayes classifier makes—now you can guess where that name comes from—is that each of the  variables in the instance vector are independent of one another. In other words, knowing a value for one of the features does not provide us with any information about the values for the other  feature columns. Combining this assumption of independence with Bayes’ theorem, we can now restate (1) as follows: Pretty straight forward. We know that the demominator, which often goes by the name “evidence” in Bayesian inference, is merely a normalizing factor to ensure that the posterior distribution integrates to 1. So we can discard this piece of information and distill (2) down even farther: Equation (3) tells us that it is possible to calculate the probability of instance  belonging to class  systematically. Why is this important? The simple answer is that we can use (3) to train the naive Bayes classifier. Say we know that for a particular instance , the label is . Then, we have to find the distribution for each feature such that we can maximize . Does this ring any bells? Yes—it is maximum a posteriori estimation! In other words, our goal would be to maximize the posterior distribution for each training instance so that we can eventually build a model that would output the most likely label that the testing instance belongs to.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"In that post, we derived the formula for cross entropy and intuitively understood it as a way of measuring the “distance” between two distributions. This is exactly what we need: a way of quantifying how different the actual and predicted class labels are! Recall the formula for cross entropy: We can consider class labels as a Bernoulli distribution where data that belongs to class 1 has probability 1 of belonging to that class 1 and probability 0 of belonging to class 0, and vice versa for observations in class 0. The logistic regression model will output a Bernoulli distribution, such as , which means that the given input has a 60 percent chance of belonging to class 1; 40 percent to class 0. Applying this to (3), we get: And that is the loss function we will use for logistic regression! The reason why we have two terms, one involving just  and another involving  is due to the structure of the Bernoulli distribution, which by definition can be written as Now that we have a loss function to work with, let’s build a function that computes cross entropy loss given  and  using (4).

However, these are topics for another post. For now, we will assume that this trick is legal and continue on. Now we have Now that we have a summation representation of , let’s move onto (11). We use the same trick we used earlier to interchange the summation and the integral. This gives us Since we have to terms with negative ones with the same exponent, we can safely remove both of them: And notice that we now have the Basel problem! If you plug in  and increment  from there, it is immediately apparent that this is the case. So there we have it, the integral representation of the Basel problem! Let’s look at another example, this time using a double integral representation. The motivation behind this approach is simple. This is a useful result, since it means that we can express the Basel problem as an integral of two different variables. Now, all we need is a summation expression before the integration. And now we are basically back to the Basel problem. Note that we can also use the interchange of integral and summation technique again to reexpress (19) as shown below.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Gaussian Mixture Models,"Before we get into the details of what the EM algorithm is, it’s perhaps best to provide a very brief overview of how the EM algorithm works. A very simple way to understand EM is to think of the Gibbs sampler. Simply put, Gibbs sampling is a way of approximating some joint distribution given conditional distributions. The underlying idea was to sample from one distribution and use that sampled result to in turn generate another sample from the next conditional distribution. One might visualize this as a chain of circular dependence: if we obtain a sample from past samples, the new sample can then be used to generate the next sample. Repeat this process until convergence, and we are done. Turns out that the Gibbs sampler can be considered a specific flavor of the EM method. Although I am still far away from fully understanding the inner-workings of the EM algorithm, the underlying idea is clear: given some sort of dependence relationship, much like we saw in the case of Gibbs sampling above, we can generate some sample in one iteration and use that sample in the next. As we will see in this section, such a relationship can clearly be established, which is why EM is so commonly used in the context of Gaussian mixture models. Let’s begin by defining some quantities, the first being the posterior distribution.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"In the classic context of ML, we want to minimize the KL divergence. In this case, however, we’re simply using KL divergence as a means of measuring distance between two parameters in defined within a distribution space. As nicely stated in layman’s term in this Medium article, … instead of “I’ll follow my current gradient, subject to keeping the parameter vector within epsilon distance of the current vector,” you’d instead say “I’ll follow my current gradient, subject to keeping the distribution my model is predicting within epsilon distance of the distribution it was previously predicting” I see this as an intuitive way of nicely summarizing why we’re using KL divergence in searching the distribution space, as opposed to using Euclidean distance in searching the parameter space. Now it’s time for us to connect the dots between KL divergence and Fisher’s matrix. Before we diving right into computations, let’s think about how or why these two concepts might be related at all. One somewhat obvious link is that both quantities deal with likelihood, or to be more precise, log likelihood. Due to the definition of entropy, KL divergence ends up having a log likelihood term, while Fisher’s matrix is the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood function, or the covariance matrix of Fisher’s score, which is the gradient of the log likelihood. Either way, we know that likelihood is the fundamental bridge connecting the two. Let’s try to compute the KL divergence between  and .",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Let’s top this discussion off with a look at the confusion matrix, which is another way of compactly encoding various pieces of information for model evaluation, namely true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Note that precision and recall are all metrics that are computed using TP, TN, FP and FN as parameters. The confusion matrix shows that our model performs well at determining the death and survival of those passengers who actually died, but performs rather poorly on those who lived. Analyses like these cannot be obtained simply by looking at accuracy, which is why plotting the confusion matrix is always a good idea to get a sense of the model’s performance.  Although the titanic dataset is considered trite, much like MNIST is in the context of DL, I still think there is a lot to be learned. Even simple ML projects like these have infinite spaces and options for exploration and experimentation. I hope to go through these classic datasets and competitions to glean insight from excellent public kernels, just like this Kaggle kernel which I referenced extensively to write this tutorial. In its inception, this post was conceived of as a simple introduction to ’s pipelines, but it eventually ballooned up into a somewhat comprehensive rundown of a little Kaggle project.

The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"Notice that introducing this new parameter does not alter the fundamental shape or path of the vector ; it merely specifies the speed at which the particle is traversing the complex plane. You might recall from high school physics that the velocity vector is a derivative of the position vector with respect to time. In other words, Where  is a vector that denotes the position of an object at time . Now, let’s assume that  is such a position vector. Then, it follows from the principles of physics that its derivative will be a velocity vector. Therefore, we have What is so special about this velocity vector? For one, we can see that it is a scalar multiple of the original position vector, . Upon closer examination, we might also convince ourselves that this vector is in fact orthogonal to the position vector. This is because multiplying a point or vector by  in the complex plane effectively flips the object’s  and  components, which is precisely what a 90 degree rotation entails. What does it mean to have a trajectory whose instantaneous velocity is perpendicular to that of the position vector? Hint: think of planetary orbits. Yes, that’s right: this relationship is characteristic of circular motions, a type of movement in which an object rotates around a center of axis. The position vector of a circular motion points outward from the center of rotation, and the velocity vector is tangential to the circular trajectory.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Perhaps we should scale this in terms of relative distances or plot it on a three dimensional space, which is exactly what we are going to in a moment. Before we jump into visualizations, however, let’s deal with the elephant in the room first: is it okay to simply chop off a few dimensions to reduce a high dimensional image to fit into three-dimensional space? To answer this question, let’s check the  matrix for this particular instance of singular value decomposition. Note that we already have the first three values of  in our hands given that  in our instantiation of singular value decomposition. The information we lose pertains to the last two values, given by  and . These values are smaller in order of magnitude compared to, for instance, the largest value of , which is . This supports the idea that the information we lose amid dimensionality reduction is minimal. Alternatively, we can also see this by taking a look at the full, unreduced version of the matrix  or . For example, the code snippet below displays the full version of the factor . It is not difficult to see that the last few columns of  contain values so small that their contribution to data is going to be minimal at best.

Dissecting LSTMs,"The raw material that we pass into this filter is in fact the cell state, processed by a  activation function. This is also a familiar structure we saw earlier in the information update sequence of the network. Only this time, we use the cell state to generate output. This makes sense somewhat intuitively, since the cell state is essentially the memory of the network, and hence to generate output would require the use of this memory. Of course, this should not be construed so literally since what ultimately happens during backpropagation is entirely up to the network, and at that point we simply lay back and hope for the network to learn the best. This point notwithstanding, I find this admittedly coarse heuristic to be nonetheless useful in intuiting the clockwork behind LSTMs. At this point, we’re not quite done yet;  is not a vector of probabilities indicating which letter is the most likely in a one-hot encoded representation. Therefore, we will need to pass it through another affine layer, than apply a softmax activation. Hence,  is the final output of an LSTM layer. Here comes the tricky part: backprop. Thankfully, backprop is somewhat simple in the case of LSTMs due to the use of Hadamard products. The routine is not so much different from a vanilla neural network, so let’s try to hash out the equations. As we already know, backpropagation in neural networks is merely an extended application of the chain rule, with some minor caveats that matrix calculus entails.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"At a glance, Euler’s identity is a confusing, mind-boggling mishmash of numbers that somehow miraculously package themselves into a neat, simple form: I remember staring at this identity in high school, trying to wrap my head around the seemingly discordant numbers floating around the equation. Today, I want to share some ideas I have learned since and demonstrate the magic that Euler’s identity can play for us. The classic proof for Euler’s identity flows from the famous Taylor series, a method of expressing any given function in terms of an infinite series of polynomials. I like to understand Taylor series as an approximation of a function through means of differentiation. Recall that a first-order derivative gives the slope of the tangent line at any given point of a function. The second-order derivative provides information regarding the convexity of the function. Through induction, we can convince ourselves that higher order derivatives will convey information about the curvature of the function throughout coordinate system, which is precisely the underlying mechanism behind Taylor’s series. In a more concise notation, we have Notice that  is the starting point of our approximation. Therefore, the Taylor series will provide the most accurate estimation of the original function around that point, and the farther we get away from , the worse the approximation will be. For the purpose of our analysis, let’s examine the Taylor polynomials for the following three functions: , and .

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"To better understand this phenomena, we probably have to run more trials with more data over longer iterations than we have done in this tutorial. This point notwithstanding, it is interesting to see how a single layer LSTM network can outperform a stacked RNN network.  The last up on this list is the one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The convent produced very remarkable results in this experiment, especially given its extremely short training time. Recurrent neural networks typically take a lot of time to train—even when they are not stacked—because each neuron is defined by a rather complicated operation involving many parameters, such as states, carriage, and so on. Convents, on the other hand, are relatively simpler, and thus take noticeably shorter to train and deploy. This tutorial demonstrates that convents can perform as well as simple recurrent networks to establish a baseline performance metric.  In this post, we briefly introduced and explored the concept of recurrent neural networks, how they work, and how to build them using the  functional API. Recurrent neural networks are one of the hottest topics in the contemporary deep learning academia because it presents numerous possibilities for applications. Hopefully this post gave you a better understanding of what all the hype is about, why RNNs are effective at what they do, and how they can be used in the context of basic natural language processing.

The Exponential Family,"Recall that Therefore, Finally, we have arrived at our destination: We finally know how to calculate the parameter under which the likelihood of observing given data is maximized. The beauty of this approach is that it applies to all probability distributions that belong to the exponential family because our analysis does not depend on which distribution is in question; we started from the canonical form of the exponential family to derive a set of generic equations. This is the convenience of dealing with the exponential family: because they are all defined by the same underlying structure, the MLE equations hold general applicability. In this post, we explored the exponential family of distributions, which I flippantly ascribed the title “The Medici of Probability Distributions.” This is obviously my poor attempt at an intellectual joke, to which many of you might cringe, but I personally think it somewhat captures the idea that many probability distributions that we see on the textbook are, in fact, surprisingly more related than we might think. At least to me, it wasn’t obvious from the beginning that the exponential and the Bernoulli distributions shared the same structure, not to mention the wealth of other distributions that belong to the exponential family.  Also, the convenient factorization is what allowed us to perform an MLE estimation, which is an important concept in statistics with wide ranging applications.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"All we have to do, therefore, is to compute the expected value of the integrand by randomly generating a series of numbers within the specified domain, plug those values into the function , and take their average. This is a very elementary function that simply generates a specified number of samples given  within the domain . These numbers are then plugged into the function , after which an unweighted mean of these values are computed to approximate an integral. Let’s test the accuracy of this crude Monte Carlo method by using our example of  computed earlier. The result is a very poor approximation that is way off, most likely because we only used ten randomly generated numbers. Much like earlier, however, we would expect Monte Carlo to perform better with larger samples. The example we have analyzed so far was a very simple one, so simple that we would probably have been better off calculating the integral by hand than writing code. That’s why it’s time to put our crude Monte Carlo to the test with integrals more difficult to compute. Consider the following expression: One might try calculating this integral through substitution or integration by parts, but let’s choose not to for the sake of our mental health. Instead, we can model the integrand in Python and ask Monte Carlo to do the work for us. Concretely, this process might look as follows.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"This block produces the following figure: I doubt that anyone would play Chutes and Ladders for this long, but after about 150 rolls of the dice, we can expect with a fair amount of certainty that the game will come to an end. The graph above presents information on cumulative fractions, but we can also look at the graph for marginal probabilities by examining its derivative: And the result: From the looks of it, the maximum of the graph seems to exist somewhere around . To be exact, . This result tells us that we will finish the game in 19 rolls of the dice more often than any other number of turns. We can also use this information to calculate the expected value of the game length. Recall that Or if the probability density function is continuous, In this case, we have a discrete random variable, so we adopt the first formula for our analysis. The formula can be achieved in Python as follows: This result tells us that the typical length of a Chutes and Ladders game is approximately 36 turns. But an issue with using expected value as a metric of analysis is that long games with infinitesimal probabilities are weighted equally to short games of substantial probability of occurrence.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"We can now plug this function into our crude Monte Carlo  and hope that the algorithm will provide us with an accurate estimation of this expression. So we have a number! But how do we know if this is an accurate estimation? Unlike in previous problems, where we already knew the true value of our estimate and measured the error of our simulation by comparing it with the known value, the true value of the integral expression is unknown in this problem because we have not evaluated the integral by hand. One way we can go about this dilemma is to calculate variance. Intuitively, if our estimate is indeed accurate, running the same Monte Carlo simulation would yield a value very similar to that of the previous. Conversely, if our estimate is inaccurate, the variance would be large, suggesting that our estimate has not converged to a value yet. Indeed, this is exactly what we attempted to visualize with the error plot above in our  estimation example. However, in most cases where Monte Carlo methods are used, we have no idea about the true value of the quantity we wish to estimate, like the complicated integral problem in this case, which is why we cannot simply calculate error by substracting our estimate from the true value.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"a head-biased coin; a larger , a tail-oriented one. When  and  take the same value, the local extrema of the Beta distribution is established at , when the coin is perfectly fair. Now that we have established the usability of the Beta function as a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function, let’s finally see Bayesian inference at work.

Notice that , which stands for data, is now given in the form  where  denotes the number of heads; , the total number of coin flips. Notice also that constants, such as the combinatorial expression or the reciprocal of the Beta function, can be dropped since we are only establishing a proportional relationship between the left and right hand sides. Further simplifications can be applied: But notice that this expression for the posterior can be encapsulated as a Beta distribution since Therefore, we started from a prior of  to end up with a posterior of . This is an incredibly powerful mechanism of updating our beliefs based on presented data. This process also proves that, as purported earlier, the Beta distribution is indeed a conjugate prior of a binomial likelihood function.

The feature columns include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Let’s begin by first loading the data set from the  library. One preliminary step we might want to take is shuffling the data set and dividing it into a training set and a testing set. As the name implies, a testing set is a set of data we use to test the accuracy of our classification algorithm. A training set, on the other hand, is a data set the KNN model is going to use to make predictions, i.e. it is the data set from which the algorithm will try to find close neighbors. There is a special function already in the  library that does all the shuffling and the splitting for us, but in light of the “from scratch” spirit of this post, let’s try to write up the function ourselves.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Using this formula, let’s plot variance against the number of samples to see what effect increasing the sample size has on variance. The  function accepts a list as an argument and returns the variance seen in the given data set.

This means that, even if we do not know the true value of the integral expression, we can now be confident that the output of the crude Monte Carlo will have converged to an approximation of the true value with sampling size as big as 1000, or even something like 400. This gives us more confidence in saying that the integral expression in (1) is approximates to 0.247. The crude Monte Carlo algorithm we employed here used simple random sampling to generate a series of random numbers to be used for our estimation.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"We would expect singular value decomposition to capture these observations in some way, albeit approximately.

These methods are where all the fun stacking and appending described above takes place. I actually added a little bit of customization to make this model a little more broadly applicable. First, I added batch normalization, which wasn’t in the original paper. Batch normalization is known to stabilize training and improve performance; it wasn’t in the original VGG paper because the batch norm technique hadn’t been introduced back when the paper was published. Also, the model above can actually handle rectangular images, not just square ones. Of course, there still is a constraint, which is that the  and  parameters must be multiples of 32.

Gaussian Process Regression,"This is where I think GPs get really interesting: the key point of GP is to realize that we want to model some smooth function that best fits our data. What does this “smoothness” mean in terms of covariance? The answer is that  values that are close to each other must be highly correlated, whereas those that are far apart would have low covariance. In other words, knowing the value of  tells us a lot about the value of , whereas it tells us very little about the value of . In short, the closer the values, the higher the covariance. So at the end of the day, all there is to GP regression is to construct this covariance matrix using some distance function. In GPs, these covariance matrices are referred to as kernels. Kernels can be understood as some sort of prior that we impose upon the regression problem. The idea of smoothness noted earlier is one such example of a prior. But it is a general prior that makes a lot of sense, since we normally don’t want stepwise or non-differential functions as the result of regression. But there are hundreds and thousands of kernels out there that each suit different purposes.

"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","At this point, it is perhaps necessary to remind ourselves of why we went down the matrix calculus route in the first place. The intuition behind this approach was that we can construct an expression for the total error given by the regression line, then derive that expression to find the values of the parameters that minimize the error function. Simply put, we will attempt to frame linear regression as a simple optimization problem. Let’s recall the problem setup from the linear algebra section above. The problem, as we framed it in linear algebra terms, went as follows: given some unsolvable system of equations , find the closest approximations of  and , each denoted as  and  respectively, such that the system is now solvable. We will start from this identical setup with the same notation, but approach it slightly differently by using matrix calculus. The first agenda on the table is constructing an error function. The most common metric for error analysis is mean squared error, or MSE for short. MSE computes the magnitude of error as the squared distance between the actual value of data and that predicted by the regression line. We square the error simply to prevent positive and negative errors from canceling each other out. In the context of our regression problem, where  denotes the error function.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I find this way of understanding data to be highly intuitive in this context. Now, it’s time to bake Bayesian philosophy into code. Recall that to perform Bayesian analysis, we first need to specify a prior. Although we could use an uninformed prior, in this case, we have data to work with. The way that makes the most sense would be to count the number of data points corresponding to each class to create a categorical distribution and use that as our prior, as shown below. If we use the  created from , we should get a very simple prior whereby  since there is an equal number of data points belonging to the two classes in the toy data set. Indeed, this seems to be true.

One useful observation to make here is the fact that the numerator itself looks a lot like something we have seen before: the Beta distribution. In fact, you might also realize that the denominator is nothing but just a normalizing constant that ensures that our posterior distribution, when integrated from 0 to 1, integrates up to 1 as the axiom of probability states. We can also see the denominator as the definition of the Beta function. In other words, Therefore, we end up with Notice that offers an extremely nice interpretation: the number of success  and failures , which are determined by , yield insight into what the true parameter is via the Beta distribution. This is why the Beta distribution is often referred to as a “probability distribution of probabilities.” I highly recommend that you read this post on cross validated for many intuitive explanations of what the Beta distribution is and how it can be useful, such as in this Bayesian context. Now we know that there is a closed-form solution for Bayesian problems involving conjugate priors and likelihood functions, such as a Beta prior coupled with the binomial likelihood.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Although I’m no science major, one of the few things that I recall from high school chemistry class is the Gibbs free energy equation for calculating the spontaneity of reactions, which went as follows: where the term for entropy, denoted as  satisfies the condition that We won’t get into the details of these equations, but an intuition that we can glean from this equation is that the randomness of a particle is determined by the number of potential states that are possible for that given particle. In other words, a gas particle that freely moves across space at ATP is going to be more random than a near-static water particle composing an ice cub. We might take a step further and say that the gas particle carries a larger amount of information than the particle in a solid since more information is required to express its randomness. Entropy in science, denoted above as , provides us with a valuable intuition on the topic of randomness and information. In fact, it is no coincidence that the notion of randomness in information theory, a subfield of math that we are going to be dipping our toes in, borrowed the term “entropy” to express randomness exhibited in data. Just like entropy was used to quantify randomness in the scientific phenomena, the notion of entropy is used in information theory to denote randomness in data.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"First, we enumerate thorugh the data set to calculate all the distances between the given test instance and the data points in the data set. Next, we sort the list. The returned result is a list that contains the indices of the  nearest neighbors the algorithm found in the data set. Note that we use the  function we wrote above. Let’s see if the code works by testing it on our toy data. The task is to find 5 data points that are closest to the first row of . As expected, the returned list contains the indices of the data points in  that are closest to . We can confirm this by looking at the results of the distance calculation we obtained when testing the  function. Note that the indices are in order; that is, indice 0 corresponds to the closet neighbor—it is in fact that data point itself—and index 2 refers to the farthest neighbor among the  selections. Say we have successfully obtained the list of  nearest neighbors. Now what? Well, it’s time to look up the labels of these neighboring data points to see which class is the most prevalent. The KNN model will then conclude that the most prevalent class label is the one that which the data point belongs to.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
The Exponential Family,"Much like in the previous post on maximum likelihood estimation, we begin with some data set of  independent and identically distributed observations. This is going to be the setup of the MLE problem. Given this dataset, the objective of maximum likelihood estimation is to identify some parameter  that maximizes the likelihood, i.e. the probability of observing these data points under a probability distribution defined by . In other words, How do we identify this parameter? Well, the go-to equipment in a mathematician’s arsenal for an optimization problem like this one is calculus. Recall that our goal is to maximize the likelihood function, which can be calculated as follows: The first equality stands due to the assumption that all data are independent and identically distributed. Maximizing (16) is a complicated task, especially because we are dealing with a large product. Products aren’t bad, but we typically prefer sums because they are easier to work with. A simple hack that we almost always use when dealing with maximum likelihood, therefore, is to apply a log transformation to calculate the log likelihood, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function. In other words, What does the log likelihood look like? Well, all we have to do is to apply a log function to (16), which yields the following result. Maximizing the log liklihood can be achieved by setting the gradient to zero, as the gods of calculus would tell us.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Gaussian Mixture Models,"If we consider GMM to be a generative model, then we can imagine the generating process as follows: At this point, for clarity’s sake, let’s introduce some notations and concretize what has been elaborated above. First, we define a categorical distribution that will represent the mixing coefficients described above. Let  be an -dimensional vector that parametrizes this categorical distribution. In other words, This means that we assume the data to have  different clusters. Each  is then a mixing coefficient that establishes the convexness of the linear combinations of the underlying Gaussians. Now we can sample the cluster index, denoted as , from the categorical distribution as shown below. Note that we use  for the cluster index, since it is considered a latent variable—we don’t observe it directly, yet it is deeply involved in the data generation process. Quite simply, the probability that a data point belongs to the th cluster is represented by . The last step to data generation, as outlined in the bullet points above, is sampling a point from the corresponding Gaussian. where  and  are the mean and covariance matrices that parameterize the th Gaussian in the mixture model. Now that we have an idea of how GMMs can serve as a generative model that describes the underlying data generation process, let’s think about the marginal probability—that is, the probability that some point  in the sample space was generated by the GMM. After all, what we observe is the final output, not the latent variables.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
Fisher Score and Information,"The next step, as we all know, is to take the derivative of the term in the argument maxima, set it equal to zero, and voila! We have found the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. A quick aside that may become later is the fact that maximizing the likelihood amounts to minimizing the loss function. Now here comes the definition of Fisher’s score function, which really is nothing more than what we’ve done above: it’s just the gradient of the log likelihood function. In other words, we have already been implicitly using Fisher’s score to find the maximum of the likelihood function all along, just without explicitly using the term. Fisher’s score is simply the gradient or the derivative of the log likelihood function, which means that setting the score equal to zero gives us the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. An important characteristic to note about Fisher’s score is the fact that the score evaluated the true value of the parameter equals zero. Concretely, this means that given a true parameter , This might seem deceptively obvious: after all, the whole point of Fisher’s score and maximum likelihood estimation is to find a parameter value that would set the gradient equal to zero. This is exactly what I had thought, but there are subtle intricacies taking place here that deserves our attention. So let’s hash out exactly why the expectation of the score with respect to the true underlying distribution is zero.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","Since this is a very simple CNN, you will see that there is nothing exciting going on; we are simply getting the output of the previous layer and passing that as input into the next. After going through some convolutions and fully connected layers, we can return the result. There are one caveats worth mentioning here, which is the use of . There is a  that I could have easily used, and indeed there is an entire discussion on the PyTorch forum on the difference between the two. The bottom line is that they are pretty similar for our purposes. The most salient difference between the two is that the functional approach cannot be used when declaring a sequential model. However, since we are defining a custom forward function, this limitation does not apply. Personally, I prefer the functional because it means that there is one less layer to declare in the initialization function. However, it’s probably better to err on the side of the  if you’re not totally sure. Now that we’ve designed and implemented a model, it’s time to train it. This is the part where people might argue that TensorFlow 2 or Keras is superior to PyTorch. In Keras, you can simply call  to train the model. However, in PyTorch, this is not necessarily the case, unless you really want to imitate the Keras API and define a  function yourself. PyTorch is more low-level in that you need to define a custom training loop manually.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Likelihood and Probability,"Recall that we are dealing with distributions here, whose PDFs are not always the simplest and the most elegant-looking. If we multiply  terms of the normal PDF, for instance, we would end up with a giant exponential term. To prevent this fiasco, we can introduce a simple transformation: logarithms. Log is a monotonically increasing function, which is why maximizing some function  is equivalent to maximizing the log of that function, . Moreover, the log transformation expedites calculation since logarithms restructure multiplication as sums. With that in mind, we can construct a log equation for MLE from (3) as shown below. Because we are dealing with Euler’s number, , the natural log is our preferred base. Using the property in (3), we can simplify the equation above: To find the maximum of this function, we can use a bit of calculus. Specifically, our goal is to find a parameter that which makes the first derivative of the log likelihood function to equal 0. To find the optimal mean parameter , we derive the log likelihood function with respect to  while considering all other variables as constants. From this, it follows that Rearranging this equation, we are able to obtain the final expression for the optimal parameter  that which maximizes the likelihood function: As part 2 of the trilogy, we can also do the same for the other parameter of interest in the normal distribution, namely the standard deviation denoted by . We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"Assuming independence on each coin toss, we can use multiplication to calculate this probability: Notice that  because we assumed the coin was fair. Had it not been fair, we would have different probabilities for  and , explained by the relationship that . This is what the binomial PMF is implying: calculating the probability that we get  successes in  trials requires that we multiply the probability of success  by  times and the probability of failure  by  times, because those are the numbers of successful and unsuccessful trials respectively. Now that we have reviewed the concept of binomial distribution, it is time to apply it to our example of phone calls at the Yongsan PMO. Although I do not have an  data sheet on me, let’s assume for the sake of convenience that, on average, 12 calls come to the PMO per shift, which is eight hours. Given this information, how can we simulate the situation as a binomial distribution? First, we have to define what constitutes a success in this situation. While there might be other ways to go about this agenda, the most straightforward approach would be to define a phone call as a success. This brings us to the next question: how many trials do we have? Here is where things get a bit more complicated—we don’t really have trials! Notice that this situation is somewhat distinct from coin tosses, as we do not have a clearly defined “trial” or an experiment.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
BLEU from scratch,"Recently, I joined the Language, Information, and Learning at Yale lab, led by Professor Dragomir Radev. Although I’m still in what I would consider to be the incipient stages of ML/DL/NLP studies—meaning it will take time for me to be able to actively participate in an contribute to research and publications—I think it will be a great learning experience from which I can glean valuable insight into what research at Yale looks like. One of the first projects I was introduced to at the lab is domain-independent table summarization. As the name implies, the goal is to train a model such that it can extract some meaningful insight from the table and produce a human-readable summary. Members are the lab seem to be making great progress in this project, and I’m excited to see where it will go. In the meantime, I decided to write a short post on BLEU, a metric that I came across while reading some of the survey papers related to this topic. Let’s dive into it. Before going into code and equations, a high-level overview of what BLEU is might be helpful here. BLEU, which stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is an metric that was introduced to quantitatively evaluate the quality of machine translations. The motivation is clear: as humans, we are able to get an intuitive sense of whether or not a given translation is accurate and of high quality; however, it is difficult to translate this arbitrary linguistic intuition to train NLP models to produce better translations.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The Math Behind GANs,"This is because the gradient of the function  is steeper near  than that of the function , meaning that trying to maximize , or equivalently, minimizing  is going to lead to quicker, more substantial improvements to the performance of the generator than trying to minimize . Now that we have defined the loss functions for the generator and the discriminator, it’s time to leverage some math to solve the optimization problem, i.e. finding the parameters for the generator and the discriminator such that the loss functions are optimized. This corresponds to training the model in practical terms. When training a GAN, we typically train one model at a time. In other words, when training the discriminator, the generator is assumed as fixed. We saw this in action in the previous post on how to build a basic GAN. Let’s return back to the min-max game. The quantity of interest can be defined as a function of  and . Let’s call this the value function: In reality, we are more interested in the distribution modeled by the generator than . Therefore, let’s create a new variable, , and use this substitution to rewrite the value function: The goal of the discriminator is to maximize this value function.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"However, we want to add some element of randomness of noise in the prediction. Why might we want to do this? Well, an intuitive pitfall we might expect is that the model might end up generating a repetition of some likely sequence of characters. For example, let’s say the model’s estimated distribution deems the sequence “God is dead” to be likely. Then, the output of our model might end up being something like this: …(some input text) God is dead God is dead God is dead… (repetition elided) We don’t want this to happen. Instead, we want to introduce some noise so that the model faces subtle obstructions, thereby making it get more “creative” with its output instead of getting trapped in an infinite loop of some likely sequence. Below is a sample implementation of adding noise to the output using log and exponential transformations to the output vector of our model. The transformation might be expressed as follows: where   denotes a transformation,  denotes a prediction as a vector,  denotes temperature as a measure of randomness, and  is a normalizing constant. Although this might appear complicated, all it’s doing is that it is adding some perturbation or disturbance to the output data so that it is possible for less likely characters to be chosen as the final prediction. Below is a sample implementation of this process in code. Note that due to the algebraic quality of the vector transformation above, randomness is increased for large values of .",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"Nonetheless, we can approximate the distribution of this random variable by considering each ten-minute blocks as a unit for a single trial, i.e. if a call is received by the PMO between 22:00 and 22:10, then the trial is a success; if not, a failure. Blocking eight hours by ten minutes gives us a total of 48 trials. Because we assumed the average number of phone calls on a single shift to be 12, the probability of success . Let’s simulate this experiment  times. We can model this binomial distribution as follows: This code block produces the following output: Under this assumption, we can also calculate how lucky I was yesterday when I only received five calls by plugging in the appropriate values into the binomial PMF function: From a frequentist’s point of view, I would have lazy days like these only 7 times for every thousand days, which is nearly three years! Given that my military service will last only 1.5 years from now, I won’t every have such a lucky day again, at least according to the binomial distribution. But a few glaring problem exists with this mode of analysis. For one, we operated under a rather shaky definition of a trial by arbitrarily segmenting eight hours into ten-minute blocks. If we modify this definition, say, by saying that a single minute comprises an experiment, hence a total of 480 trials, we get a different values for  and , which would clearly impact our calculation of .",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
