An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"In the Metrapolis-Hastings model, the proposal distribution is assumed as normal. Next, we have to decide if the current value of  is a value to accept or not. Accepting a randomly sampled value means adding it to our list of historic observations—if we draw a histogram of the entries in this list, it is our hope that we would end up with a close approximation of the posterior distribution. Accepting this value is often referred to as a “jump,” because we can visualize this process as a random walk in the posterior sample space from point  to . The question is, how do we decide to jump or not? The answer lies in Bayes’ theorem: If, for example, we should accept the value and perform the jump, because this means that the new proposed parameter does a better job of explaining the data than does the current one. But recall the dilemma we discussed earlier: how do we compute the posterior? After all, the complexity of calcualting evidence was the very reason why scientists came up with MCMC in the first place. Well, here’s a clever trick that might be of use: rearrange (5) in fractional form to get rid of the evidence term in the denominator. In other words, (5) can be reexpressed as which means The evidence term nicely disappears, giving us an expression that we can easily evaluate! This is how Metropolis-Hastings resolves the dilemma of evidence computation—very simple yet some surprisingly effective algebra.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"For control our experiment, we will train all four models over the same , , and . There isn’t much exciting here to look at it terms of code; it’s just a matter of patience, waiting for the models to hopefully converge to a global minimum. For future reference, all training history is dumped in the  object where  corresponds to the model number. After a long time of waiting, the training is finally complete! If you are following this tutorial on your local workstation, please note that the time required for training may vary depending on your hardware configurations or the specification of our instance if you are using a cloud-based platform like AWS. None of our models reached the threshold of ninety percent accuracy, but they all managed to converge to some reasonable number, hovering around the high seventies to low eighties. Let’s test the performance of our models by using the  and  data, both of which none of our models have seen before. Based on the results, it looks like the LSTM model performed best, beating other models by a small margin. At this point, we cannot conclude as to whether or not this marginal boost in performance is significant. Judging this would not only depend on the context, but also most likely require us to have a larger test dataset that captures the statistics of the population data. This point notwithstanding, it is certainly beneficial to know that LSTM networks are good at detecting sequential patterns in data.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Gaussian Mixture Models,"In other words, All this is doing is that we are using the marginal distribution expression we derived earlier and applying that to a situation in which we have  data points instead of just one, which is the context we have been operating in so far. We multiply the probabilities given the assumption of independence. From the perspective of maximum likelihood estimation, the goal then would be to maximize this likelihood to find the optimal parameters for  and . Before we attempt MLE with the likelihood function, let’s first try to calculate the log likelihood, as this often makes MLE much easier by decoupling products as summations. Let . And now we see a problem: the log is not applied to the inside of the function due to the summation. This is bad news since deriving this expression by  will become very tedious. The result is for sure not going to look pretty, let’s try deriving the log likelihood by  and set it equal to zero. At least one good news is that, for now, we can safely ignore the outer summation given the linearity of derivatives. We ultimately end up with the expression below: This is not pretty at all, and it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to solve analytically for . This is why we can’t approach MLE the way we usually do, by directly calculating derivatives and setting them equal to zero. This is where Expectation Maximization, or EM algorithm comes in.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Fast Gradient Sign Method,"It might seem like there is a lot going on in the code block below, but really, a lot of it is just some grunt work I’ve done to display the examples in a nice grid with headers and labels. Let’s take a look at the adversarial examples that have been generated for each value of epsilon.  It’s really interesting to see how our model could confuse some of these examples. Granted, not all handwritings are obvious, and there are definitely ones that could be tricky. However, as the value of epsilon goes up, it appears that even obvious digits can be mistaken by the model to be some other digit that bears no resemblance. This is adversarial attack in action. In today’s post, we discussed adversarial attacks, specifically the fast gradient sign method. Although I tried to get a little technical by going through each equation in the original paper (and even then, I skipped a few), the overarching idea behind FGSM, as I understand it, is surprisingly simple: neural networks are more linear than we think, and we can create gradient-based, small perturbations that can maximize the loss, thus disrupting the model’s behavior. Since FGSM, other more advanced attack methods have been introduced. Nowadays, building robust models that can withstand such attacks are becoming increasingly important. FGSM is an example of a white-box attack method: in this case, we had full access to the gradients and parameters of the model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"The biggest difference between correlation and covariance is that correlation is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas covariance is unbounded. The bottom line is that both correlation and covariance measure the strength of linearity between two variables, with correlation being a normalized version of covariance. At this point in time, one might point out that covariance is not really a multivariate concept since it is defined for only two variables, not three or more. Indeed, the expression  is mathematically incoherent. However, covariance can be  a multivariate metric since we can express the covariance of any pairs of random variables by constructing what is called the covariance matrix. Simply put, the covariance matrix is a matrix whose elements are the pairwise covariance of two random variables in a random vector. Before we get into the explanation, let’s take a look at the equation for the covariance matrix: where  and . This is the matrix analogue of the expression which is an alternate definition of variance. It is natural to wonder why we replaced the squared expression with  instead of  as we did earlier with the term in the exponent. The simplest answer that covariance is expressed as a matrix, not a scalar value. By dimensionality,  produces a single scalar value, whereas  creates a matrix of rank one.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
The Exponential Family,"Recall that Therefore, Finally, we have arrived at our destination: We finally know how to calculate the parameter under which the likelihood of observing given data is maximized. The beauty of this approach is that it applies to all probability distributions that belong to the exponential family because our analysis does not depend on which distribution is in question; we started from the canonical form of the exponential family to derive a set of generic equations. This is the convenience of dealing with the exponential family: because they are all defined by the same underlying structure, the MLE equations hold general applicability. In this post, we explored the exponential family of distributions, which I flippantly ascribed the title “The Medici of Probability Distributions.” This is obviously my poor attempt at an intellectual joke, to which many of you might cringe, but I personally think it somewhat captures the idea that many probability distributions that we see on the textbook are, in fact, surprisingly more related than we might think. At least to me, it wasn’t obvious from the beginning that the exponential and the Bernoulli distributions shared the same structure, not to mention the wealth of other distributions that belong to the exponential family.  Also, the convenient factorization is what allowed us to perform an MLE estimation, which is an important concept in statistics with wide ranging applications.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"Conceptually, we can think of  as the previous point of the parameter and  as the newly updated parameter. In this context, the KL divergence would tell us the effect of one iteration of natural gradient descent. This time, instead of using integral, let’s try to simplify a bit by expressing quantities as expectations. We see the familiar log likelihood term. Given the fact that the Fisher matrix is the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood, we should be itching to derive this expression twice to get a Hessian out of it. Let’s first obtain the gradient, then get its Jacobian to derive a Hessian. This derivation process was heavily referenced from Agustinus Kristiadi’s blog. Let’s do this one more time to get the Hessian. This conclusion tells us that the curvature of KL divergence is defined by Fisher’s matrix. In hindsight, this is not such a surprising result given that the KL divergence literally had a term for expected log likelihood. Applying the Leibniz rule twice to move the derivative into the integral, we quickly end up with Fisher’s matrix. At this point, you might be wondering about the implications of this conclusion. It’s great that KL divergence and the Fisher matrix are closely related via the Hessian, but what implication does it have for the gradient descent algorithm in distribution space? To answer this question, we first need to perform a quick multivariate second order Taylor expansion on KL divergence.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","First, let’s remind ourselves of what  and  are: Let’s begin our calculation: Calculating the inverse, Now, we can put this all together. The final result tells us that the line of best fit, given our data, is Let’s plot this line alongside our toy data to see how the equation fits into the picture.  It’s not difficult to see that linear regression was performed pretty well as expected. However, ascertaining the accuracy of a mathematical model with just a quick glance of an eye should be avoided. This point then begs the question: how can we be sure that our calculated line is indeed the best line that minimizes error? To that question, matrix calculus holds the key. We all remember calculus from school. We’re not going to talk much about calculus in this post, but it is definitely worth mentioning that one of the main applications of calculus lies in optimization: how can we minimize or maximize some function, optionally with some constraint? This particular instance of application is particularly pertinent and important in our case, because, if we think about it, the linear regression problem can also be solved with calculus. The intuition behind this approach is simple: if we can derive a formula that expresses the error between actual values of  and those predicted by regression, denoted as  above, we can use calculus to derive that expression and ultimately locate the global minimum. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","The Beta distribution looks as follows: where Comparing (3) and the integral representation of the Beta function in (4), you will see that there is a clear resemblance, and this is no coincidence. In the Beta distribution, the Beta function which appears in the denominator is simply a normalizing constant that ensures that integrating the probability distribution function from 0 to 1 produces 1. The specifics of the Beta function and how it relates to the Gamma function might be a topic for a another post. For now, it suffices to show the general probability function as well as its building blocks, namely the Beta function itself. These will become relevant later when we derive the posterior with a binomial likelihood function to show conjugacy. To prove conjugacy, it suffices to show that multiplying a Beta prior with a binomial likelihood produces a Beta posterior. Roughly speaking, the big picture we will be using is essentially equation (1). For notation consistency, I decided to use  for conditional probability and  for function parametrization. For a rather pedantic discussion on this notational convention, I recommend that you take a quick look at this cross validated post. Let’s now plug in the Beta and binomial distributions into (5) to see what comes out of it. This is going to be a lot of computation, but the nice part of it is that a lot of terms cancel out each other. We can easily see that there are constant that exist both in the numerator and the denominator.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"We can somewhat intuit this through Euler’s identity, which is basically telling us that there exists some inextricable relationship between real and imaginary numbers. Understood from this point of view, we see that the power operation can be defined in the entire space that is complex numbers. We can also take logarithms of negative numbers. This can simply be shown by starting from Euler’s identity and taking the natural log on both sides. In fact, because  is a periodic function around the unit circle, any odd multiple of  will give us the same result. While it is true that logarithmic functions are undefined for negative numbers, this proposition is only true in the context of real numbers. Once we move onto the complex plane, what may appear as unintuitive and mind-boggling operations suddenly make mathematical sense. This is precisely the magic of Euler’s identity: the marriage of different numbers throughout the number system, blending them together in such a way that seems so simple, yet so incomprehensibly complex and profound.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"When we read, we don’t process a given text at once in its totality; instead, we break them down into pieces, such as a word or a bag of words, and build our understanding based on information obtained from the previous sequence of text. In other words, processing information through reading is at best understood as a process of continuously receiving new information while retaining information obtained from the previous sequence. This is why recurrent neural network models are frequently employed in the context of natural language processing. But the applications of RNNs extends beyond the domain of NLP. For example, say we are given a dataset of temperature recording of a city district. Obviously, the structural integrity of that dataset is very important, i.e. we should not shuffle the datasets because making weather predictions requires us to understand temporal patterns. In predicting the weather 24 hours from today, data points pertaining to the last two days will be obviously much more important that those recorded a month ago. In such instances of time series analysis, recurrent neural networks perform better than other models we have looked at thus far. To better understand how RNNs work, let’s try to build a very simple recurrent neural network from scratch with . We will only implement forward propagation for the sake of simplicity,  but with some matrix calculus, one can imagine how deriving the formula for back propagation will be possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"If you are wondering how (1) translates to the return statement, then the following equation might resolve your curiosity. This is the promised elaboration on the relationship between log variance and standard deviation: Therefore, multiplying 0.5 is just a simple algebraic manipulation to morph log variance to standard deviation. The reason why we use log variance instead of just variance or standard deviation is to ensure numerical stability in computation. Now that this part has been cleared, let’s start stacking away layers! Just like the autoencoder, VAEs are composed of two discrete components: the encoder and the decoder. Here, we take a look at the first piece of the puzzle, the encoder network. There are several things to note about this model. First, I decided to use a  loop to simplify the process of stacking layers. Instead of repeating the same code over multiple lines, I found this approach to be more succinct and concise. Second, we define a custom layer at the end, shown as , that uses the  function we defined earlier. This is the final key that enables us to build an encoder model that receives as input a 28-by-28 image, then output a two-dimensional latent vector representation of that image to pass onto the decoder network. Below is the summary of what our model looks like. Note that the model outputs a total of three quantities: , , and .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"The implication of this decision is that the prior collapses to a constant. Given the nature of the derived MAP formula in (5), constants can safely be ignored as it will not contribute to argument maximization in any way. Concretely, Therefore, in the case of a uniform prior, we see that MAP essentially boils down to MLE! This is an informative result that tells us that, at their core, MLE and MAP seek to perform the same operation. However, MAP, being a Bayesian approach, takes a specified prior into account, whereas the frequenting MLE simply seeks to dabble in data only, as probabilities are considered objective results of repeated infinite trials instead of subjective beliefs as a Bayesian statistician would purport.

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"In PyTorch, RNN layers expect the input tensor to be of size . Since every name is going to have a different length, we don’t batch the inputs for simplicity purposes and simply use each input as a single batch. For a more detailed discussion, check out this forum discussion. Let’s quickly verify the output of the  function with a dummy input. Now we need to build a our dataset with all the preprocessing steps. Let’s collect all the decoded and converted tensors in a list, with accompanying labels. The labels can be obtained easily from the file name, for example . We could wrap this in a PyTorch  class, but for simplicity sake let’s just use a good old  loop to feed this data into our model. Since we are dealing with normal lists, we can easily use ’s  to separate the training data from the testing data. Let’s see how many training and testing data we have. Note that we used a  of 0.1. We will be building two models: a simple RNN, which is going to be built from scratch, and a GRU-based model using PyTorch’s layers. Now we can build our model. This is a very simple RNN that takes a single character tensor representation as input and produces some prediction and a hidden state, which can be used in the next iteration.

BLEU from scratch,"Now we’re almost done. The last example to consider is the following translation: This is obviously a bad translation. However, due to the way modified precision is currently being calculated, this sentence will likely earn a high score. To prevent this from happening, we need to apply what is known as brevity penalty. As the name implies, this penalizes short candidate translations, thus ensuring that only sufficiently long machine translations are ascribed a high score. Although this might seem confusing, the underlying mechanism is quite simple. The goal is to find the length of the reference sentence whose length is closest to that of the candidate translation in question. If the length of that reference sentence is larger than the candidate sentence, we apply some penalty; if the candidate sentence is longer, than we do not apply any penalization. The specific formula for penalization looks as follows: The brevity penalty term is multiplied to the n-gram modified precision. Therefore, a value of 1 means that no penalization is applied. Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see whether the brevity penalty function works as expected. Finally, it’s time to put all the pieces together. The formula for BLEU can be written as follows: First, some notation clarifications.  specifies the size of the bag of word, or the n-gram.  denotes the weight we will ascribe to the modified precision——produced under that -gram configuration.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"We see that accuracy spikes up on the first 20- epochs or so and quite quickly converges to about 90 percent. Past a certain threshold, the model seems to hover consistently at around the high 90s range, but accuracy still continues to increase ever so slightly with each epoch, though not as quickly as before. If we set the learning rate  to a smaller number, we would expect the model to take a lot longer to tune, and indeed this seems to be true:  With a much smaller learning rate, the model seems to struggle to achieve high accuracy. However, although there are a lot of uneven spikes, the model still manages to reach a pretty high accuracy score by 200 epochs. This tells us that the success of model training depends a lot on how we set the learning rate; setting an excessively high value for the learning rate might result in overshooting, while a low learning rate might prevent the model from quickly learning from the data and making meaningful progress. Accuracy helps us intuitively understand how well our model is doing, but recall that the main objective of gradient descent is not to maximize accuracy, but to minimize the cross entropy loss function. Therefore, perhaps it makes more sense to evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model by plotting cross entropy. Presented below is a simple function that plots epoch versus cross entropy given a list of learning rates, . Let’s plot cross entropy loss for three different values of : 0.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Moments in Statistics,"All the magic happens when we derive this function with respect to .

If we derive the function again and do the same, And by induction, we can see how the th derivative of the MGF at  would give us the th moment of the distribution, . The easiest way to demonstrate the usefulness of MGF is with an example. For fun, let’s revisit a distribution we examined a long time ago on this blog: the Poisson distribution. To briefly recap, the Poisson distribution can be considered as an variation of the binomial distribution where the number of trials, , diverges to infinity, with rate of success defined as . This is why the Poisson distribution is frequently used to model how many random events are likely in a given time frame. Here is the probability distribution of the Poisson distribution. Note that  denotes the number of occurrences of the random event in question. The task here is to obtain the mean of the distribution, i.e. to calculate the first moment, .

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Neural networks are powerful models that can be used to identify complex hidden patterns in data. There are many types of neural networks, two of which we have seen already on this blog: the vanilla, feed-forward neural network and convolutional neural networks, often abbreviated as convnets. Today, we will add a third kind to this exciting mix: recurrent neural networks, or RNNs. Let’s take a brief conceptual look at how recurrent neural networks work, then implement a toy RNN to see how it compares to other models on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. I heavily borrowed my examples from Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet and the tutorial on text classification available from the official TensorFlow documentation. Recurrent neural networks, as the name implies, refer to neural network models that contain some sort of internal looping structure that simulates a flow of information. A good way to conceptualize this loop is to think of something like  loops, where a certain operation is performed repeatedly for a specified number of cycles. Given these pieces of information, we might ask ourselves two questions. Firstly, what does this looping operation involve? Secondly, what is the purpose of having this loop in the first place? Let’s try to answer both questions in the following subsections. One of the most salient features of a recurrent neural network is that it is capable of emulating some primitive form of memory. Why might we want to do this? Well, take the example of reading a text.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
BLEU from scratch,"Recently, I joined the Language, Information, and Learning at Yale lab, led by Professor Dragomir Radev. Although I’m still in what I would consider to be the incipient stages of ML/DL/NLP studies—meaning it will take time for me to be able to actively participate in an contribute to research and publications—I think it will be a great learning experience from which I can glean valuable insight into what research at Yale looks like. One of the first projects I was introduced to at the lab is domain-independent table summarization. As the name implies, the goal is to train a model such that it can extract some meaningful insight from the table and produce a human-readable summary. Members are the lab seem to be making great progress in this project, and I’m excited to see where it will go. In the meantime, I decided to write a short post on BLEU, a metric that I came across while reading some of the survey papers related to this topic. Let’s dive into it. Before going into code and equations, a high-level overview of what BLEU is might be helpful here. BLEU, which stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is an metric that was introduced to quantitatively evaluate the quality of machine translations. The motivation is clear: as humans, we are able to get an intuitive sense of whether or not a given translation is accurate and of high quality; however, it is difficult to translate this arbitrary linguistic intuition to train NLP models to produce better translations.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
MLE and KL Divergence,"We will revisit JSD in the future when we discuss the mathematics behind GANs. But for now, it suffices to know what KL divergence is and what it measures. Now that we have reviewed the essential concepts that we need, let’s get down to the proof. Let’s start with the statement of the parameter  that minimizes the KL divergence between the two distribution  and the approximate distribution : Not a lot has happened in this step, except for substituting the  expression with its definition as per (2). Observe that in the last derived expression in (4), the term  does not affect the argument of the minima, which is why it can safely be omitted to yield the following simplified expression: We can change the argument of the minima operator to the maxima given the negative sign in the expression for the expected value. To proceed further, it is necessary to resort to the Law of Large Numbers, or LLN for short. The law states that the average of samples obtained from a large number of repeated trials should be close to the expected value of that random variable. In other words, the average will approximate the expected value as more trials are performed. More formally, LLN might be stated in the following fashion. Suppose we perform an experiment involving the random variable  and repeat it  times. Then, we would obtain a set of indecent and identically distributed (i.i.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","Then, much like the Newton-Raphson method, we find the -intercept of that secant line, find a new point on the graph whose -coordinate corresponds to that intercept, and use the point from the previous iteration to find a new secant line. This process is very intuitively outlined in this video by numericalmethodsguy. The update rule for the secant method can be expressed as We can derive (7) simply by slightly modifying the update rule we saw for Newton-Raphson. Recall that the Newton-Raphson update rule was written as The only modification we need to make to this update rule is to replace  with an approximation using the backward divided difference formula. Here, we make a slight modification to (2), specifically by using values from previous iterations. If we plug (8) back into (4), with some algebraic simplifications, we land on (7), the update rule for the secant method. This is left as an exercise for the reader. Now let’s take a look at how we might be able to implement this numerical method in code. Presented below is the  method, which follows the same general structure as the  function we looked at earlier. The only part that differs is the part where we use backward divided difference, which requires that we look up not only the immediately previous root approximation, but the value prior to that as well.

Word2vec from Scratch,"While this is a relatively simple, basic implementation of word2vec, the underlying principle remains the same nonetheless.

If you end up training word embeddings on large datasets like Wikipedia, you end up with things like word2vec and GloVe, another extremely popular alternative to word2vec.

Bayesian Linear Regression,"We might also notice that the sampled regression lines seem to stay below the true regression line for smaller values of . This is because we have more samples beneath the true regression line that we have above it. Bayesian linear regression is able to account for such variations in data and uncertainty, which is a huge advantage over the simple MLE linear regression method. The true power of Bayesian linear regression might be summarized as follows: instead of returning just a single line using the MLE weight estimate of data, Bayesian linear regression models the entire data set to create a distribution of linear functions so to speak, allowing us to sample from that distribution to obtain sample linear regression lines. This is an approach that makes much more sense, since it allows us to take into account the uncertainty in our linear regression estimate. The reason why the normal equation method is unable to capture this uncertainty is that—as you might recall from the derivation of the formula for vanilla linear regression—the tools we used did not involve any probabilistic modeling. Recall that we used only linear algebra and matrix calculus to derive the model for vanilla linear regression. Bayesian linear regression is more complicated in that it involves computations with probability density functions, but the end result is of course more rewarding. That’s it for today!

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","7 is a familiar value, and indeed it is what was returned by the Newton-Raphson method as well. We confirm that this is indeed the root of the equation. Now that we have looked at both methods, it’s time to make a quick comparison. We will be comparing three different methods: By setting  to be , we can obtain a full list of root updates as the three methods begin their quest for the root of the function. We can then see which method converges the quickest. Let’s see how this little experiment turns out. We first begin by importing some dependencies to plot the history of values. Then, we obtain the history for each of the three approaches and plot them as a scatter plot. The result is shown below.  You might have to squint your eye to see that  (Netwon-Raphson with direct derivatives) and  (Newton-Raphson with center divided difference) almost coincide exactly at the same points. I was honestly somewhat surprised by the result: although we had verified the advantage of using center divided difference over forward or backward divided difference via some simple big-O analysis with trailing error terms, I did not expect the two to coincide with such exactitude. Another interesting observation is that the secant method seems to take slightly longer than the Newton-Raphson method. This is probably due to the fact that the secant method uses backward divided difference, and also the fact that it requires two previous at each iteration instead of one.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
My First GAN,"Generative models are fascinating. It is no wonder that GANs, or General Adversarial Networks, are considered by many to be where future lies for deep learning and neural networks. In this post, we will attempt to create a very simple vanilla GAN using TensorFlow. Specifically, our goal will be to train a neural network that is capable of generating compelling images of ships. Although this is a pretty mundane task, it nonetheless sheds lights on the potential that GAN models hold. Let’s jump right into it. Below are the dependencies and settings we will be using throughout this tutorial. Before we start building the GAN model, it is probably a good idea to define some variables that we will be using to configure the parameters of convolutional layers, namely the dimensionality of the images we will be dealing with, as well as the number of color channels and the size of the latent dimension. Similar to variational autoencoders, GANs are composed of two parts: the generator and the discriminator. As Ian Goodfellow described in the paper where he first put out the notion of a GAN, generators are best understood as counterfeiters of currency, whereas the discriminator is the police trying to distinguish the fake from the true. In other words, a GAN is a two-component model that involves an internal tug-of-war between two adversarial parties, each trying their best to accomplish their mission.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Stirling Approximation,"Then,  will be a new Poisson random variable with mean . If we extend this idea to apply to  independent random variables instead of just two, we can conclude that  collection of independent random variables from  to  sampled from a population of mean  will have mean . And by the nature of the Poisson distribution, the same goes for variance (We will elaborate on this part more below). The Central Limit Theorem then tells us that the distribution of the sum of these random variables will approximate a normal distribution. This concludes a rough proof of the Stirling approximation. For those of you who are feeling rusty on the Poisson distribution as I was, here is a simple explanation on the Poisson—specifically, its mean and variance. By the virtue of the definition of the parameter, it should be fairly clear why :  is a rate parameter that indicates how many events occur within a window of unit time. The expected calculation can easily be shown using Taylor expansion: Next, we prove that the variance of a Poisson random variable defined by parameter  is equal to . Let  be a Poisson random variable. Then, Then, using the definition of variance, we know that From this, we are once again reminded of the defining property of the Poisson, which is that both the mean and variance of a Poisson random variable is defined by the parameter .

Neural Style Transfer,"The key here is that the Gram matrix is largely location agnostic; all the information related to locations or positions in the image is lost in the calculation. This is expected, and in some ways desirable, since the style of an image is largely independent from its spatial features. Another key point is that, the style of an image can be thought of as an amalgamation of different combinations of each feature. For instance, Van Gogh’s style of painting is often associated with strong, apparent brush strokes. It is possible to decompose and analyze this style into a set of co-occurring features, such as thick line edges, curves, and so on. So in a sense, the Gram matrix encodes such information at different depths of the pretrained feature extractor, which is why it is fitting to use the Gram matrix for calculating style loss. Concretely, the equation for style loss goes as follows: The style loss is similar to content loss in the sense that it is also a sum of element-wise L2 norms of two matrices. The differences are that we are using the Gram matrix instead of the raw activations themselves, and that we have a scaling constant. But even this constant is a pretty minor change, as I have seen implementations where the style weight was made a trainable parameter as opposed to a fixed scalar. As stated earlier, this tutorial seeks to explain the original NMT algorithm.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Fourier Series,"Recall that Euler’s formula is a piece of magic that connects all the dots of mathematics. Here is the familiar equation: Using Euler’s formula, we can formulate an alternative representation of Fourier series: Let’s unequivocally drive this concept home with a simple example involving the Dirac delta function. The delta function is interesting function that looks like this:  The delta function has two nice properties that make it great to work with. First, it integrates to one if the domain includes . This is the point where the graph peaks in the diagram. Second, the delta function is even. This automatically tells us that when we perform a Fourier expansion, we will have no sine functions—sine functions are by nature odd. With this understanding in mind, let’s derive the Fourier series of the Dirac delta by starting with . The equality is due to the first property of the delta function outlined in the previous paragraph. The derivation of the rest of the constants can be done in a similar fashion. The trick is to use the fact that the delta function is zero in all domains but . Therefore, the oscillations of  will be nullified by the delta function in all but that one point, where  is just one.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Fast Gradient Sign Method,"In this context, it means that the largest magnitude of the element in  does not exceed the precision constraint . Then, Goodfellow proceeds to explain the maximum bounds of this perturbation. Namely, given that the maximum bound of the change in activation can be written as where the average magnitude of an element of  is given by , and . This tells us that the change in activation given by the perturbation increases linearly with respect to , or the dimension. In other words, in sufficiently high-dimensional contexts, we can expect even a small perturbation capped at  to produce a perturbation big enough to render the model susceptible to an adversarial attack. Such perturbed examples as referred to as adversarial examples. The equations above demonstrated that the degree of perturbation increases as dimensionality increases. In other words, we established that creating adversarial examples are possible via infinitesimal perturbations. In this section, let’s dive into the specifics of FGSM. The idea behind FGSM is surprisingly simple: we do opposite of the typical gradient descent in order to maximize the loss, since confusing the model is the end goal of adversarial attack. Therefore, we consider , the model’s input, to be a trainable parameter. Then, we add the gradient to its original input variable to create a perturbation. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows: where  represents the cost function.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
PyTorch Tensor Basics,"One of the main takeaways from that experience is that an intuition on dimensionality and tensor operations in general is a huge plus. This gets especially important for things like batching. One very basic thing I learned–admittedly perhaps too belatedly–is the difference between  and  as dimensions. Here is a concrete example. This creates a one-dimensional tensor, which is effectively a list. We can check the dimensions of this tensor by calling , which is very similar to how NumPy works. On the other hand, specifying the size as  results in a two-dimensional tensor. The simple, barely passing answer to the question of why  is two-dimension would be that it has double layered brackets. More exactly speaking, having an additional layer means that it is capable of storing another tensor within it; hence,  is living in a dimension that is one above that of . As mentioned earlier, batch dimension is something that becomes very important later on. Some PyTorch layers, most notably RNNs, even have an argument , which accepts a boolean value. If , PyTorch expects the first dimension of the input to be the batch dimension. If , which is the case by default, PyTorch assumes that the first dimension would be the sequence length dimension. A common operation that is used when dealing with inputs is , or its inverse, . Before explaining what these operations perform, let’s just take a look at an example. Let’s start with , the random tensor of size  initialized above.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"I therefore decided to create a much more contrived example, but with many coordinates, so that we can easily verify whether the path decided on by the algorithm is indeed the optimal path. Namely, we will be arranging city coordinates to lie on a semi-circle, using the very familiar equation Let’s create 100 such fake cities and run the genetic algorithm to optimize the path. If the algorithm does successfully find an optimal path, it will be a single curve from one end of the semi-circle fully connected all the way up to its other end.  The algorithm seems to have converged, but the returned  does not seem to be the optimal path, as it is not a sorted array from 0 to 99 as we expect. Plotting this result, the fact that the algorithm hasn’t quite found the most optimal solution becomes clearer. This point notwithstanding, it is still worth noting that the algorithm has found what might be referred to as optimal segments: notice that there are some segments of the path that contain consecutive numbers, which is what we would expect to see in the optimal path.  An optimal path would look as follows.  Comparing the two, we see that the optimal path returned by the genetic algorithm does contain some wasted traveling routes, namely the the chords between certain non-adjacent cities. Nonetheless, a lot of the adjacent cities are connected (hence the use of the aforementioned term, optimal segments).",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"In other words, each integer corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary of the dataset. More specifically, the integer to which a word is mapped corresponds to the frequency with which the word appears, i.e. the word encoded as 10 corresponds to the 10th most frequent word in the data. We will apply some very basic preprocessing on the dataset so that we can feed it into our model. Specifically, we will preprocess the dataset such that only a  number of most frequently occurring words are considered. This step will weed out words that occur very infrequently, thus decreasing the amount of noise from the network’s perspective. Next, we will apply padding to the dataset so that all reviews are of length . This means that longer reviews will be truncated, whereas shorter reviews will be padded with zero entries. Below is a sample code implementation of this process. Let’s load the data using the  function after specifying necessary parameters. Now that the data is here and ready to go, it’s time to  build our neural network. To spice things up a bit, let’s create four different models and compare their performance. Before we jump into that, however, we first need to understand what an embedding layer is, as it is key to natural language processing. Simply put, an embedding layer is a layer that transforms words or integers that encode words into dense vectors. This is a necessary transformation since neural networks are incapable of dealing with non-quantitative variables.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Neural Style Transfer,"In today’s post, we will take a look at neural style transfer, or NMT for short. NMT is something that I first came across about a year ago when reading Francois Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python book. At that time, I was just getting my feet wet in deep learning with Keras, and I specifically remember myself skipping the chapter on NMT, feeling unprepared and intimidated by the implementation. After a full year, I feel ready to face the challenge, but this time with PyTorch. Let’s get started! Before we get into any specific implementation details, it’s probably helpful to provide some context on how NMT works. Note that, among the many variations of the NMT algorithm, we are going to be discussing the original one first introduced by Gatys et. al. The goal of NMT is simple: given a content image and a style image, transform the content image to have the look and feel of the style image. Below is an example taken from Yunjey’s PyTorch tutorial, which has been an amazing resource so far in my PyTorch journey.  One peculiarity in the original NMT algorithm is that, unlike in typical scenarios in which we update the model’s parameters training, in NMT we update the pixel values of the clone of the content image itself to gradually stylize it.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
The Gibbs Sampler,"Theoretically, it doesn’t matter what these random numbers are—asymptotically speaking, we should still be able to approximate the final distribution, especially if given the fact that we take burn-in into account. On the first iteration, we will begin by sampling from the first probability distribution. Note that we simply used the initial random values for  through  to sample the first value from a conditional probability distribution. Now, we do the same to sample . Only this time, we can use the result from earlier, namely . We can see how this might help us yield a slightly more convincing result than simply using the random data. We still have to use random values for  through  since we haven’t sampled from their relevant conditional distributions just yet. However, as we go through all the random variables in order, it becomes obvious that we will no longer be using randomly initialized values at one point. Specifically, on the th iteration, we would expect something like this to happen:  can be any number between 1 and , since it is used to represent the th random variable. As we repeat more iterations of sampling, we will eventually end up with a plausible representation of -dimensional vectors, which is what we sought to sample from the intractable distribution! In this section, we will take a look at a very simple example, namely sampling from a bivariate Gaussian distribution.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"This function tells us that our movie application should recommend to our user Movies 3 and 4, in that order. This result is not surprising given the fact that we have already observed the closeness between Movies 2 and 3—if a user likes Movie 2, we should definitely recommend Movie 3 to them. Our algorithm also tells us that the distance between Movie 2 and 4 is also pretty close, although not as close as the distance between Movies 2 and 3. What is happening behind the scene here? Our function simply calculates the distance between the vector representation of each movies as a dot product. If we were to print the local variable  array defined within the  function, for instance, we would see the following result. This tells us how close Movies 0, 1, 3, and 4 are with Movie 2. The larger the dot product, the closer the movie; hence, the more compelling that recommendation. The  function then sorts the  array and outputs the first  movies as a recommendation. Of course, we could think of an alternate implementation of this algorithm that makes use of the  matrix instead of , but that would be a slightly different recommendation system that uses past user’s movie ratings as information to predict whether or not the particular individual would like a given movie. As we can see, SVD can be used in countless ways in the domain of recommendation algorithms, which goes to show how powerful it is as a tool for data analysis.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"The iris data set from the UCI machine learning repository is perhaps one of the best known data sets in the field of machine learning. Created by R. A. Fisher, the data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, totaling to 150 independent observations of iris plants, specifically Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The feature columns include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Let’s begin by first loading the data set from the  library. One preliminary step we might want to take is shuffling the data set and dividing it into a training set and a testing set. As the name implies, a testing set is a set of data we use to test the accuracy of our classification algorithm. A training set, on the other hand, is a data set the KNN model is going to use to make predictions, i.e. it is the data set from which the algorithm will try to find close neighbors. There is a special function already in the  library that does all the shuffling and the splitting for us, but in light of the “from scratch” spirit of this post, let’s try to write up the function ourselves. Great! We can now use this function to split the iris data set we have imported by using the following command. Let’s verify that the splitting has successfully been performed by checking the dimensions of the testing set. As we expect, the testing set is a 30-by-4 matrix.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Continuing, the next subject of our interest would be , as the variance is only strictly defined for one variable, as expressed by its definition below: where  is a random variable, which takes a scalar value. This necessarily begs the question: what is the multivariable equivalent of variance? To answer this question, we need to understand covariance and the covariance matrix. To jump right into the answer, the multivariable analogue of variance is covariance, which is defined as Notice that  equals variance, which is why we stated earlier that covariance is the multivariate equivalent of variance for univariate quantities. The intuition we can develop from looking at the equation is that covariance measures how far our random variables are from the mean in the  and  directions. More concretely, covariance is expresses the degree of association between two variables. Simply put, if there is a positive relationship between two variables, i.e. an increase in one variable results in a corresponding increase in the other, the variance will be positive; conversely, if an increase in one variable results in a decrease in the other, covariance will be negative. A covariance of zero signifies that there is no linear relationship between the two variables. At a glance, the concept of covariance bears strong resemblance to the notion of correlation, which also explains the relationship between two variables. Indeed, covariance and correlation are related: in fact, correlation is a function of covariance.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Gamma and Zeta,"Maintaining momentum in writing and self-learning has admittedly been difficult these past few weeks since I’ve started my internship. Normally, I would write one post approximately every four days, but this routine is no longer the norm. To my defense, I’ve been learning a ton about Django and backend operations like querying and routing, and I might write a post about these in the future. But for today, I decided to revisit a topic we’ve previously explored on this blog, partially in the hopes of using nostalgia as positive energy in restarting my internal momentum. I must also note that I meant to write this post for a very long time after watching this video by blackpenredpen whose videos have been a source of mathematical learning and inspiration for me. Let’s talk about the Gamma and Zeta functions. Before we begin the derivation, perhaps it’s a good idea to review what the two greek letter functions are. The Gamma function is written as And we all know that the Gamma function can be seen as an interpolation of the factorial function, since for non-negative integers, the following relationship stands: Note that there is also a variant of the Gamma function, known as the Pi function, which has somewhat of a nicer form: To the mathematically uninformed self, the Pi function seems a lot more tractable and intuitive. Nonetheless, the prevailing function is Euler’s Gamma function instead of Gauss’s Pi function. The reasons for Gamma’s dominance over Pi is discussed extensively in this math overflow thread.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gamma and Zeta,"At any rate, it’s both interesting and yet also unsurprising to see that these two functions are brainchildren of Gauss and Euler, two names that arguably appear the most in the world of math. The Riemann zeta function is perhaps one of the most famous functions in the world of analysis. It is also sometimes referred to as the Euler-Riemann zeta function, but at this point, prefixing something with “Euler” loses significance since just about everything in mathematics seems to have some Euler prefix in front of it. The Riemann zeta function takes the following form: But this definition, as simple and intuitive as it is, seems to erroneously suggest that the Riemann zeta function is only defined over non-negative integers. This is certainly not the case. In fact, the reason why the Riemann zeta function is so widely studied in mathematics is that its domain ranges over the complex number plane. While we won’t be discussing the complexity of the Riemann zeta function in this regard (no pun intended), it is nonetheless important to consider about how we might calculate, say, . This is where the Gamma function comes in. As hinted earlier, an alternative definition of the Riemann zeta function can be constructed using the Gamma function that takes the Riemann zeta beyond the obvious realm of integers and into the real domain. We first start with a simple change of variables. Specifically, we can substitute  for .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Let’s cut to the chase: RNNs emulate memory by using the output from the previous sequence as an input to the next. Perhaps writing this down in matrix notation might give you a better idea of what the statement above means. Here is one way we might implement a very simple recurrent neural network. If the word “recursion” pops up into your mind, then you are on the right track. Notice that in calculating , the output of the current sequence, the output of the previous sequence,  is used. By using the output of the previous sequence, the recurrent neural network is able to “remember” some of the information that was produced by the previous input. Granted, this is not exactly what memory is or how it works in the strictest sense, but we can see how some information from the previous input is trickling down to affect the computation of the current sequence of input data. Note that I used  for the example, but we can just about use any other activation function. Here is one way we might implement this in Python. Although not necessary, I decided to opt for a class-based implementation to make things look tight and nicer. Let’s create a  class object to see that everything works properly. There is really not much point in seeing the output because the calculations are going to be based off of randomly generated data and randomly created weights, but perhaps there is something to be learned from the dimensionality of input and output data.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"As always, we will be using the  functional API to build our neural network. We will be training our neural network to speak like the great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (or his English translations, to be more exact). First, let’s build a function that retrieves the necessary  text file document from the web to return a Python string. Let’s take a look at the text data by examining its length. Just to make sure that the data has been loaded successfully, let’s take a look at the first 100 characters of the string. ## Preprocessing It’s time to preprocess the text data to make it feedable to our neural network. As introduced in this previous post on recurrent neural networks, the smart way to deal with text preprocessing is typically to use an embedding layer that translates words into vectors. However, text embedding is insuitable for this task since our goal is to build a character-level text generation model. In other words, our model is not going to generate word predictions; instead, it will spit out a character each prediction cycle. Therefore, we will use an alternative technique, namely mapping each character to an integer value. This isn’t as elegant as text embedding or even one-hot encoding but for a character-level analysis, it should work fine. The  function takes a string text data as input and returns a list of training data, each of length , sampled every  characters. It also returns the training labels and a hash table mapping characters to their respective integer encodings.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"In a previous post, we took a look at Fisher’s information matrix. Today, we will be taking a break from the R frenzy and continue our exploration of this topic, meshing together related ideas such as gradient descent, KL divergence, Hessian, and more. The typical formula for batch gradient descent looks something like this: This is the familiar gradient descent algorithm that we know of. While this approach works and certainly makes sense, there are definite limitations; hence the introduction of other more efficient algorithms such as SGD, Adam, and et cetera. However, these algorithms all have one thing in common: they adjust the parameter in the parameter space according to Euclidean distance. In other words, gradient descent essentially looks at regions that are some Euclidean distance away from the current parameter and chooses the direction of steepest descent. This is where the notion of natural gradients come into play: if our goal is to minimize the cost function, which is effectively equivalent to maximizing the likelihood, why not search within the distribution space of the likelihood function instead? After all, this makes more sense since gradient descent in parameter space is likely to be easily perturbed by the mode of parametrization, such as using precision instead of variance in a normal distribution, whereas searching in the distribution space would not be subject to this limitation. So the alternative to this approach would be to search the distribution space and find the distribution that which makes value of the cost function the smallest.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The main takeaway here is the the gradient descent method allows us to find the local minimum of any convex function, no matter how multidimensional or complex. This is an incredibly powerful statement, and it is one that lies at the core of many machine learning algorithms. To implement gradient descent with code, we have to figure out what the gradient descent equation is in the case of logistic regression. To do this, we need a bit of calculus work using the chain rule. Recall that our goal is to compute since we want to calculate the slope of the cross entropy function with respect to the weights vector. For notational convenience, let’s denote the gradient as a derivative: The gradient in (7) can be broken down into distinct components via the chain rule: where So the task of calculating the gradient now boils down to finding the derivative for each of the terms shown in (8). Let’s start with the easiet one, the last term, which is the derivative of  with respect to . From (9), we can conclude that The next in line is the derivative of the sigmoid function, which goes as follows: Now we are almost there.

"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","In a previous post, we looked at the Poisson distribution as a way of modeling the probability of some event’s occurrence within a specified time frame.

While we clearly established the fact that the Poisson distribution was a more accurate representation of the situation than the binomial distribution, we ran into a problem at the end of the post: how can we derive or integrate the Poisson probability distribution, which is discontinuous? To recap, let’s reexamine the Poisson distribution function: As you can see, this function is discontinuous because of that one factorial term shamelessly flaunting itself in the denominator. The factorial, we might recall, is as an operation is only defined for integers. Therefore, although we can calculate expression such as , we have no idea what the expression  evaluates to. Or do we? Here is where the Gamma function kicks in. This is going to be the crux of today’s post. Let’s jump right into it by analyzing the Gamma function, specifically Euler’s integral of the second kind: At a glance, it is not immediately clear as to why this integral is an interpolation of the factorial function.

MLE and KL Divergence,"d, which is the assumption that we make to build models such as naïve Bayes, and so on. For now, it suffices to clarify that the goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the optimal parameter of a distribution that best captures some given data. KL divergence is a concept that arises from the field of information theory that is also heavily applied in statistics and machine learning. KL divergence is particularly useful because it can be used to measure the dissimilarity between to probability distributions. The familiar equation for KL divergence goes as follows: In Bayesian terms, KL divergence might be used to compare the prior and the posterior distribution, where  represents the posterior and , the prior. In machine learning,  is often the true distribution which we seek to model, and  is the approximation of that true distribution, which is also the prediction generated by the model. Note that KL divergence is not a true measure of distance, since it is asymmetric. In other words, The focus of this post is obviously not on distance metrics, and I plan on writing a separate post devoted to this topic. But as a preview of what is to come, here is an appetizer to get you interested.

Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"Turns out that under certain conditions, we can exchange the summation and the integral (or, more strictly speaking, the limit and the integral), using things like the dominating convergence theorem of Fubini’s theorem.

If you plug in  and increment  from there, it is immediately apparent that this is the case. So there we have it, the integral representation of the Basel problem! Let’s look at another example, this time using a double integral representation. The motivation behind this approach is simple. This is a useful result, since it means that we can express the Basel problem as an integral of two different variables. Now, all we need is a summation expression before the integration.

VGG PyTorch Implementation,"Whenever we encounter , we would append a max pool layer to that stack.

These methods are where all the fun stacking and appending described above takes place. I actually added a little bit of customization to make this model a little more broadly applicable. First, I added batch normalization, which wasn’t in the original paper. Batch normalization is known to stabilize training and improve performance; it wasn’t in the original VGG paper because the batch norm technique hadn’t been introduced back when the paper was published. Also, the model above can actually handle rectangular images, not just square ones. Of course, there still is a constraint, which is that the  and  parameters must be multiples of 32. Let’s roll out the model architecture by taking a look at VGG19, which is the deepest architecture within the VGG family.

We can clearly see the two submodules of the network: the convolutional portion and the fully connected portion. Now let’s see if all the dimensions and tensor sizes match up.

(Attempt at) Knowledge Distillation,"For the past couple of months or so, I’ve been spending time looking into transformers and BERT. Transformers are state of the art NLP models that are now replacing traditional RNNs in countless NLP tasks. One benefit of transformers is that, unlike RNNs, which require data to be input as a sequence, they can handle tokens all at once in parallel. This post is not going to be about transformers or BERT, but it does touch on a relevant topic. Transformers are huge architectures that can have as many as a few million trainable parameters. Hence, training transformers are extremely expensive, and only companies with a lot of computing resources can afford to train such models in their GPU or TPU clusters for extended periods of time. This is why so many people are interested in model compression. Huge models are not only difficult to train, but also requires good enough computing power. In other words, on-device inference is very difficult. People have thus started to look at various model compression techniques. Today, we will be discussing one such technique, known as knowledge distillation, introduced in Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network, by Hinton et. al. Let’s get started. In knowledge distillation, we assume two models: a teacher and student models. The teacher is the big, cumbersome model we seek to compress. As you may have guessed, the student is the compressed result of the teacher model. The object of knowledge distillation is to train the student to mimic the logits produced by the teacher.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In today’s post, we dealt primarily with singular value decomposition and its application in the context of recommendation systems. Although the system we built in this post is extremely simple, especially in comparison to the complex models that companies use in real-life situations, nonetheless our exploration of SVD is valuable in that we started from the bare basics to build our own model. What is even more fascinating is that many recommendation systems involve singular value decomposition in one way or another, meaning that our exploration is not detached from the context of reality. Hopefully this post has given you some intuition behind how recommendation systems work and what math is involved in those algorithms. On a tangential note, recently, I have begun to realize that linear algebra as a university subject is very different from linear algebra as a field of applied math. Although I found interest in linear algebra last year when I took the course as a first-year, studying math on my own has endowed me with a more holistic understanding of how the concepts and formulas we learned in linear algebra class can be used in real-life contexts. While I am no expert in pedagogy or teaching methodology, this makes me believe that perhaps linear algebra could be taught better if students were exposed to applications with appropriate data to toy around with.

Likelihood and Probability,"After a little bit of rearranging, we end up with Finally, we have obtained the parameter values for the mean and variance of a normal distribution that maximizes the likelihood of our data. Notice that, in the context of normal distributions, the ML parameters are simply the mean and standard deviation of the given data point, which closely aligns with our intuition: the normal distribution that best explains given data would have the sample mean and variance as its parameters, which is exactly what our result suggests. Beyond the specific context of normal distributions, however, MLE is generally very useful when trying to reconstruct or approximate the population distribution using observed data. Let’s wrap this up by performing a quick verification of our formula for maximum likelihood estimation for normal distributions. First, we need to prepare some random numbers that will serve as our supposed observed data. We then calculate the optimum parameters  and  by using the formulas we have derived in (5) and (6). We then generate two subplots of the log likelihood function as expressed in (4), where we vary  while keeping  at  in one and flip this in the other. This can be achieved in the following manner.

As you might be able to guess from one of the imported modules, the objective of the neural network will be to classify hand-written digits. In doing so, we will be dealing with a classic in machine learning literature known as the the MNIST data set, which contains images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9, each hand-labeled by researchers.

BLEU from scratch,"Although this can sound like a lot, really it’s just putting all the pieces we have discussed so far together. Let’s take a look at the code implementation. The weighting happens in the  part within the generator expression within the  statement. In this case, we apply weighting across  that goes from  to . Now we’re done! Let’s test out our final implementation with  for  from 1 to 4, all weighted equally. The  package offers functions for BLEU calculation by default. For convenience purposes, let’s create a wrapper functions. This wrapping isn’t really necessary, but it abstracts out many of the preprocessing steps, such as applying . This is because the  BLEU calculation function expects tokenized input, whereas  and  are untokenized sentences. And we see that the result matches that derived from our own implementation! In this post, we took a look at BLEU, a very common way of evaluating the fluency of machine translations. Studying the implementation of this metric was a meaningful and interesting process, not only because BLEU itself is widely used, but also because the motivation and intuition behind its construction was easily understandable and came very naturally to me. Each component of BLEU addresses some problem with simpler metrics, such as precision or modified precision. It also takes into account things like abnormally short or repetitive translations. One area of interest for me these days is seq2seq models. Although RNN models have largely given way to transformers, I still think it’s a very interesting architecture worth diving into.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The benefit of working with this dumb example is that we can analytically derive a closed-form exprerssion for the posterior distribution. This is because a normal prior is conjugate with a normal likelihood of known variance, meaning that the posterior distribution for the mean will also turn out to be normal. If you are wondering if this property of conjugacy is relevant to the notion of conjugacy discussed above with Bayesian inference, you are exactly correct: statisticians have a laundry list of distributions with conjugate relationships, accessible on this Wikipedia article. The bottom line is that we can calculate the posterior analytically, which essentially gives us an answer with which we can evaluate our implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The equation for the posterior is presented below. This assumes that the data is normally distributed with known variance and that the prior is normal, representable as For a complete mathematical derivation of (8), refer to this document. As we will see later on, we use (9) to calculate the likelihood and (10) to calculate the prior. For now, however, let’s focus on the analyticial derivation of the posterior. This can be achieved by translating the equation in (8) into code as shown below. Let’s see what the posterior looks like given the prior . For sample observations, we use the toy data set  we generated earlier.  There we have it, the posterior distribution given sample observations and a normal prior.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Complex Fibonacci,"Then, in the next call of , the program recalculates the same values calculated earlier, up until the th fibonacci number, just one short of the previous one. The classic way to deal with this problem is to use a technique known as memoization. The idea is simple: we keep some sort of memo or cache of values that have already been calculated and store them in some data structure that we don’t have to recalculate values that have already been computed prior. Here is a simple implementation. To see how effective memoization is compared to vanilla recursion, let’s use the  module. Comparing this to the  test on  with memoization, the benefits of caching becomes immediately clear: 3 second and 150 nanoseconds are different by orders of magnitude, and we only asked the functions to calculate the 35th fibonacci number. We can get a sense of how quickly this disparity would grow if we try to calculate something like the 1000th fibonacci number in the sequence. Another perk of using caching as above is that we can now get the full sequence up to the 35th fibonacci number. Although memoization is interesting, it is not the main topic of today’s post. Instead, I want to discuss Binet’s formula, a formula with which we can calculate the th fibonacci number. Binet’s formula states that We can trivially verify that  and that .

Bayesian Linear Regression,"Although it may seem as if we made zero progress by unpacking , this process is in fact necessary to complete the square of the exponent according to the Gaussian form after making the substitutions By now, you should be comfortable with this operation of backtracking a quadratic and rearranging it to complete the square, as it is a standard operation we have used in multiple parts of this process. Finally, we have derived the predictive distribution in closed form: With more simplification using the , it can be shown that And there’s the grand formula for Bayesian linear regression! This result tells us that, if we were to simply get the best point estimate of the predicted value , we would simply have to calculate , which is the tranpose product of the MAP estimate of the weights and the input vector! In other words, the answer that Bayesian linear regression gives us is not so much different from vanilla linear regression, if we were to reduce the returned predictive probability distribution into a single point. But of course, doing so would defeat the purpose of performing Bayesian inference, so consider this merely an intriguing food for thought. As promised, we will attempt to visualize Bayesian linear regression using the  library. Doing so will not only be instructive from a perspective of honing probabilistic programming skills, but also help us better understand and visualize Bayesian inference invovled in linear regression as explored in the context of this article.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Neural Style Transfer,"Finally, this is where all the fun part takes place. For each step, we obtain intermediate representations by triggering a forward pass. Then, for each layer, we calculate the content loss and style loss. The code is merely a transcription of the loss equations as defined above. In particular, calculating the Gram matrix might appear a little bit complicated, but all that’s happening is that we are effectively flattening each activation to make it a single matrix, then calculating the Gram via matrix multiplication with its transpose. We see that style loss decreases quite a bit, whereas the content loss seems to slightly increase with each training step. As stated earlier, it is difficult to optimize on both the content and style, since altering the style of the picture will end up affecting its content in one way or another. However, since our goal is to stylize the target image via NMT, it’s okay to sacrifice a little bit of content while performing NMT, and that’s what is happening here as we can see from the loss values. And here is the result of the transformation!  The result is… interesting, and we certainly see that somethings have changed. We see some more interesting texture in the target image, and there appears to be some changes.

The Exponential Family,"This was the hard part: now, all that is left is to configure the rest of the functions to complete the factorization. One possible answer is presented below: By now, it should be sufficienty clear that the definition of the exponential family is robust enough to encompass at least the two probability distributions: the exponential and the Bernoulli. Although we do not go over other examples in this article, the exponential family is a well-defined set of probability distributions that, at thei core, are defined by a common structure. And as we will see in the next section, this underlying similarity makes certain calculations surprisingly convenient. In a previous post, we explorerd the notion of maximum likelihood estimation, and contrasted it with maximum a posteriori estimation. The fundamental question that maximum likelihood estimation seems to answer is: given some data, what parameter of a distribution best explains that observation? This is an interesting question that merits exploration in and of itself, but the discussion becomes a lot more interesting and pertinent in the context of the exponential family. Before diving into MLE, let’s define what is known as the canonical form of the exponential family. Despite its grandiose nomenclature, the canonical form simply refers to a specific flavor of factorization scheme where in which case (3) simplifies to We will assume some arbitrary distribution in the exponential family following this canonical form to perform maxmimum likelihood estimation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"For example, a simple random sampling of the population might reveal that 15 percent of the sample population is affected with the flu, but this would most likely produce a normal distribution with mean centered around 0.15 instead of a point probability. From a Bayesian standpoint, we would then replace the point probability in our example above with an equation for the distribution, from which we can proceed with the Bayesian analysis of updating our prior with the posterior through repeated testing and computation. Bayes’ theorem, specifically in the context of statistical inference, can be expressed as where  stands for observed or measured data,  stands for parameters, and  stands for some probability distribution. In the language of Bayesian inference,  is the posterior distribution for the parameter ,  is the likelihood function that expresses the likelihood of having parameter  given some observed data ,  is the prior distribution for the parameter , and  is evidence, the marginal probability of seeing the data, which is determined by summing or integrating across all possible values of the parameter, weighted by how strongly we believe in those particular values of . Concretely, Notice that this is not so different from the expansion of the denominator we saw with Bayes’ theorem, specifically equation (5). The only difference here is that the integral takes continuous probability density functions into account, as opposed to discrete point probabilities we dealt with earlier.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"If you think about it for a second, this is a very intuitive definition of randomness: the more random and infrequent an event is, the more information would be required to represent it. With this in mind, now we move onto the bigger picture: entropy in the context of random variables. In the previous section, we looked at how random events can be represented as information in bits. What’s important here was that we were dealing with isolated random events instead of random variables. For example, in the fair coin toss example, we dealt with information involved with  and , not the binomial random variable  itself. This is an important distinction to make, because entropy is essentially a probabilistically weighted average of all the random events that a random variable can take. In other words, entropy is defined as the weighted average of information given by each random event: For the continuous case, we would use an integral instead. Say  denotes the random variable of interest in a fair coin toss. Then, we are most interested in how much bits, on average, we would need to encode information generated from the distribution of this random variable. Using (3), we can easily answer this question by calculating the follows: This tells us that the entropy involved in a fair coin toss is 1 bit, i.e, on average, we only need a single digit of binary number to encode information given by a fair coin toss.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"How do we find this distribution? Well, we know one handy concept that measures the difference or the pseudo-distance between two distributions, and that is Kullback-Leibler divergence. As we discussed in this post on entropy, KL divergence tells us how different two distributions are. So the goal here would be find a distribution that minimizes the following expression: Using the definition of conditional probability, we can simplify (4) as follows: The trick is to notice that  is a constant that can break out of the expectation calculation. Let’s continue by deriving an expression for the evidence term. A useful property to know about KL divergence is the fact that it is always non-negative. We will get into why this is the case in a moment. For now, let’s assume non-negativity to be true and transform (6) into an inequality: The term on the right of the inequality is known as the Evidence Lower Bound, or ELBO for short. Why are we interested in ELBO? First, note that , the evidence, is a constant. Therefore, minimizing KL divergence amounts to maximizing ELBO. This is the key to variational inference: instead of calculating the intractable integral in (3), we can find a distribution  that which minimizes KL divergence by maximizing ELBO, which is a tractable operation. Let’s prove why KL divergence is always greater or equal to zero, which is a condition we assumed to be true in the derivation of ELBO above. For the sake of completeness, I present two ways of proving the same property.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
First Neural Network with Keras,"But because cross entropy is often not easy to intuitively wrap our minds around, let’s pass the  metric to the  function, as shown below.

As promised, we will use the  to stop graident descent from making unnecessary computations down the road. We also specify that  and  are components of the validation set. Keras shows us how much our neural network improves over each epoch. This is convenient, but can we do better? The answer is a sure yes. Let’s quickly plot a graph to see how model accuracy improves over time, while cross entropy loss decreases with more epochs.  As the last step, we might want to save our trained model. This can be achieved with a single line of code. We can load pre-saved models as well. That’s it for today! Obviously there are a lot more we can do with , such as building deeper neural networks or non-sequential models such as CNN or GAN, but these are topics we might look at a later date when I grow more proficient with the Keras API and deep learning in general.

Gaussian Process Regression,"However, we would expect them to look even smoother had we augmented the dimensions of the test data to 100 dimensions or more. Next, we need a function from which we generate dummy train data. For the purposes of demonstration, let’s choose a simple sine function. Let’s generate 15 training data points from this function. Note that we are performing a noiseless GP regression, since we did not add any Gaussian noise to . However, we already know how to perform GP with noise, as we discussed earlier how noise only affects the diagonal entries of the kernel. Now it’s time to model the posterior. Recall that the posterior distribution can be expressed as If we use  or  functions to calculate the inverse of the kernel matrix components, out life would admittedly be easy. However, using inversion is not only typically costly, but also prone to inaccuracy. Therefore, we instead opt for a safer method, namely using .

Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"To recap, from a very high level, Fourier expansion is a way of expressing some function in terms of trigonometric functions. If Taylor expansion used polynomials as the building block, Fourier expansion uses sines and cosines. A generic formula for the Fourier transform can be expressed as follows: With some integration, it can be shown that where  refers to the domain of integration. For instance, if we are integrating from  to , . A classic interval that is most commonly used is , and this is no coincidence: notice that, when , the Taylor series shown in (2) simplifies into the following: And indeed this is the format and the interval we will be using when constructing a Fourier series to tackle the Basel problem. To continue, we can derive a very similar expression for , given the specified interval from . Now that we have reviewed what Fourier series is and how we can construct it, let’s jump into the Basel problem. Just like the Taylor series, we can use Fourier expansion to represent any function continuous function. For our purposes, let’s try to expand a simple polynomial function, , using Fourier. We can begin with . Let’s continue with finding the even coefficients corresponding to the cosines. With some integration by parts, we can all agree that where the  terms appear because we end up plugging  into , a periodic function. And we can do the same for sine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fast Gradient Sign Method,"Then, the logits of the classier would be This means that, given a small perturbation , the actual effect of the perturbation on the logits of the classifier is given by . The underlying idea behind FGSM is that we can find some  that causes a change that is non-perceivable and ostensibly innocuous to the human eye, yet destructive and adverse enough for the classifier to the extent that its predictions are no longer accurate. Let’s put this into context by considering an example. Say we have some image classifier that receives RBG images as input. Typical RGB images have integer pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. These values are typically preprocessed through division by 255. Hence, the precision of data is limited by this eight-bit bottleneck. This means that, for perturbations below , we should not expect the classifier to output a different prediction. In other words, the addition of  should not cause the model to behave any different in the absence of any perturbation. An adversarial example is one that which maximizes the value of  to sway the model into making a wrong prediction. Of course, there is a constraint to be placed on ; otherwise, we could just apply a huge perturbation to the input image, but then the perturbation could be visible enough to change the ground truth label.

First Neural Network with Keras,"specifies the number of iterations the gradient descent algorithm will run for. Let’s begin by loading the data from . Now we have to slightly modify the loaded data so that its dimensions and values are made suitable to be fed into a neural network. Changing the dimensionality of data can be achieved through the  function, which takes in the number of rows and columns as its argument. We convert the numbes into type , then normalize it so that its values are all between 0 and 1. Although we won’t get into too much detail as to why normalization is important, an elementary intuition we might develop is that normalization effectively squishes all values into the same bound, making data much more processable. We also implement one-hot encoding on  through the  function. Let’s quickly check if the necessary adjustments were made by looking up the dimensions of  and , respectively. Looks like the data has been reshaped successfully. Now, it’s finally time to get into the nuts and bolts of a neural network.

This is by no means a comprehensive guide, and I could not even tell anyone that I “know” how to use PyTorch. Nonetheless, I’m glad that I was able to gain some exposure to the famed PyTorch module. Also, working with Django has somewhat helped me grasp the idea of classes more easily, which certainly helped me take in class-based concepts in PyTorch more easily. I distinctively remember people saying that PyTorch is more object-oriented compared to TensorFlow, and I might express agreement to that statement after having gone through the extreme basics of PyTorch. In the upcoming articles, I hope to use PyTorch to build more realistic models, preferrably in the domain of NLP, as that seems to be where PyTorch’s comparative advantage stands out the most compared to TensorFlow. Of course, this is not to say that I don’t like TensorFlow anymore, or that PyTorch is not an appropriate module to use in non-NLP contexts: I think each of them are powerful libraries of their own that provide a unique set of functionalities for the user.

Thus, we need the input vector for reference purposes, and this is done via stashing it in the  variable. We will see how we can incorporate  into the model in the next section. In this example, we’ll take a look at an extremely simple model to gain a better understanding of how everything comes into play in a more practical example.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"We can combine the two integrals to form an iterated integral of the following form: The term  rings a bell, and that bell sounds like circles and therefore polar coordinates.

Using the chain rule in reverse, we get We can consider there to be 1 in the integrand and continue our calculation. The result: From (4), we can express  in terms of : After applying the substitution, now our probability density function looks as follows: To figure out what  is, let’s try to find the variance of , since we already know that the variance should be equal to . In other words, from the definition of variance, we know that Using (5), we get We can use integration by parts to evaluate this integral. This integral seems complicated, but if we take a closer look, we can see that there is a lot of room for simplification. First, because the rate of decay of an exponential function is faster than the rate of increase of a first-order polynomial, the first term converges to zero.

So What are Autoencoders?,"In today’s post, we will take yet another look at an interesting application of a neural network: autoencoders. There are many types of autoencoders, but the one we will be looking at today is the simplest variant, the vanilla autoencoder. Despite its simplicity, however, there is a lot of insight to glean from this example—in fact, it is precisely the simplicity that allows us to better understand how autoencoders work, and potentially extend that understanding to to analyze other flavors of autoencoders, such as variational autoencoder networks which we might see in a future post. Without further ado, let’s get started. We begin by importing all modules and configurations necessary for this tutorial. How do autoencoders work? There are entire books dedicated to this topic, and this post in no way claims to introduce and explore all the fascinating complexities of this model. However, one intuitive way to understand autoencoders is to consider them as, lo and behold, encoders that map complex data points into vectors living in some latent dimension. For example, a 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image might be compressed into a five-dimensional latent vector. The five numbers composing this vector somehow encodes the core information needed to then decode this vector back into the original 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Also, this is a dummy example, and we can imagine a lot of situations where we might want to write custom functions to carry out specific tasks. Much like TensorFlow, PyTorch offers to ways of declaring models: function-based and class-based methods. Although I have just started getting into PyTorch, my impression is that the later is more preferred by PyTorch developers, whereas this is not necessarily the case with Keras or . Of course, this is a matter of preference and development setting, so perhaps such first impression generalizations do not carry much weight.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"We need the first two parameters to later sample from the latent distribution; , of course, is needed to train the decoder. The decoder network looks similar to the the encoder, except that much of the architecture is in reverse order. Most notably, we use  to undo the convolution done by the encoder. This allows us to effectively scale up the input back to its original dimension, which is what we want to do with a generative model like a VAE. One subtly worth mentioning is the fact that we use a sigmoid activation in the end. This is because we want the pixel values of the output to be between 0 and 1, just as the original input was normalized before it was fed into the encoder network via division by 255. The summary of the decoder network is presented below: Now that we have both the encoder and the decode network fully defined, it’s time to wrap them together into one autoencoder model. This can simply achieved by defining the input as the input of the encoder—the normalized MNIST images—and defining the output as the output of the decoder when fed a latent vector. Concretely, this process might look as follows: Let’s look a the summary of the CVAE. Note that the encoder and the decoder look like individual layers in the grand scheme of the VAE architecture.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Normally, defining a loss function is very easy: in most cases, we  use pre-made loss functions that are available through the TensorFlow API, such as cross entropy or mean squared error. In the case of variational autoencoders, however, this is not such an easy task: how do we judge the robustness or the effectiveness of the decoder, which is essentially a generative algorithm? Of course, we could stop training once the figures it generates becomes reasonable, i.e. the mock MNIST digits it creates looks compelling to the human eye. However, this is a subjective metric at best, and we can’t expect there to be a ML engineer peering at the screen, looking at the outputs of the decoder per each epoch. To tackle this challenge, we need to dive into some math. Let’s take a look. First, let’s carefully review what our goal is for this task. The motivating idea behind variational autoencoders is that we want to model a specific distribution, namely the distribution of the latent space given some input. As you recall, this latent space is a two dimensional vector modeled as a multivariate diagonal Gaussian. Using Bayes’ theorem, we can express this distribution as follows: By now, it is pretty clear what the problem its: the evidence sitting in the denominator is intractable.

In other words, This means that we assume the data to have  different clusters. Each  is then a mixing coefficient that establishes the convexness of the linear combinations of the underlying Gaussians. Now we can sample the cluster index, denoted as , from the categorical distribution as shown below. Note that we use  for the cluster index, since it is considered a latent variable—we don’t observe it directly, yet it is deeply involved in the data generation process. Quite simply, the probability that a data point belongs to the th cluster is represented by . The last step to data generation, as outlined in the bullet points above, is sampling a point from the corresponding Gaussian. where  and  are the mean and covariance matrices that parameterize the th Gaussian in the mixture model. Now that we have an idea of how GMMs can serve as a generative model that describes the underlying data generation process, let’s think about the marginal probability—that is, the probability that some point  in the sample space was generated by the GMM. After all, what we observe is the final output, not the latent variables.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"These days, machine learning and deep neural networks are exploding in importance. These fields are so popular that, unless you’re a cave man, you have probably heard it at least once. The exaggeration not withstanding, there is perhaps no necessity to justify the topic for today’s blog post: exploring a machine learning algorithm by building it from scratch. Apparently, “from scratch” is now a trendy pedagogical methodology employed in many websites and resources that claim to educate their readers about machine learning. To this, I agree: by constructing algorithms from the ground up, one can glean meaningful insights on how machine learning actually works, as opposed to viewing ML as some dark magic that suddenly makes computers intelligible beings. Enough of the prologue, let’s jump right in. As the name implies, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm works by findinng the nearest neighbors of some give data. Then, it looks at the labels of  neighboring points to produce a classification prediction. Here,  is a parameter that we can tweak to build the KNN model. For instance, let’s say we have a binary classification problem. If we set  to 10, the KNN modell will look for 10 nearest points to the data presented. If among the 10 neighbors observed, 8 of them have the label 0 and 2 of them are labeled 1, the KNN algorithm will conclude that the label of the provided data is most likely also going to be 0.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This network pretty much follows the standard vanilla convolutional neural network model, which typically involves stacking convolution, batch normalization, and pooling layers on top of each other. The dropout layers were also added so as to minimize any potential overfitting. The  argument was configured as , named after Kaiming He who found the optimal weight initialization kernel for convolutional layers. The  argument ensures that the the feature maps are not downsized too quickly due to repeated applications of convolution and pooling. The  layer simply normalizes the tensor returned from the previous layer. There are ongoing research as to what effect batch normalization has on neural networks, but the general consensus is that it helps the model learn more quickly and efficiently. The  function returns the predefined sequential model, compiled using the configurations as shown below. Let’s take a look at the summary of the model. The summary shows that this model has 551,466 trainable parameters. The memory capacity of this model is not big, but it is definitely larger than the network we built in the previous post using the Keras API. Now that the model is ready to be deployed, we need to train and test the model. But before that, let’s quickly define a function that will provide us with a visualization of how the model is learning.

Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Therefore, it is important to consider which features are potentially the most important and zoom into these deciding parameters for hypterparameter optimization.

It’s worth noting that the algorithm decided that the  is superior to , which in my opinion is no surprise. However, it is interesting to see our intuition being vindicated in this fashion nonetheless. Now it’s time for us to evaluate the model. While there are many different metrics we can use, in binary classification, we can look at things like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Let’s take a look. The pipeline seems to be working correctly as expected, preprocessing and imputing the data as it was fit on the training data, then generating predictions using the model with optimized parameters. Let’s see how well our model is doing. One useful function in  is the  function, which, as the name implies, gives us a comprehensive report of many widely-used metrics, such as precision, recall, and the F1 score.

Likelihood and Probability,"Recall that we are dealing with distributions here, whose PDFs are not always the simplest and the most elegant-looking. If we multiply  terms of the normal PDF, for instance, we would end up with a giant exponential term. To prevent this fiasco, we can introduce a simple transformation: logarithms. Log is a monotonically increasing function, which is why maximizing some function  is equivalent to maximizing the log of that function, . Moreover, the log transformation expedites calculation since logarithms restructure multiplication as sums. With that in mind, we can construct a log equation for MLE from (3) as shown below. Because we are dealing with Euler’s number, , the natural log is our preferred base. Using the property in (3), we can simplify the equation above: To find the maximum of this function, we can use a bit of calculus. Specifically, our goal is to find a parameter that which makes the first derivative of the log likelihood function to equal 0. To find the optimal mean parameter , we derive the log likelihood function with respect to  while considering all other variables as constants. From this, it follows that Rearranging this equation, we are able to obtain the final expression for the optimal parameter  that which maximizes the likelihood function: As part 2 of the trilogy, we can also do the same for the other parameter of interest in the normal distribution, namely the standard deviation denoted by . We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Introduction to seq2seq models,"For a very long time, I’ve been fascinated by sequence-to-sequence models. Give the model a photo as input, it spits out a caption to go along with it; give it some English text, it can translate it into another language. Seq2seq models are also not only widely applicable in different contexts, but it also arguably laid the groundwork for other more advanced models that came after, such as attention and transformers. In studying seq2seq models, I found Ben Trevett’s sequence modeling tutorials extremely helpful. In particular, this post is heavily based off of this notebook. With that cleared up, let’s get started! For this tutorial, we will need to import a number of dependencies, mainly from  and .  is a library that provides a nice interface to dealing with text-based data in PyTorch. includes a  class, which essentially allows us to define some preprocessing steps to be applied on the data. We will be using the  dataset, which contains translations of short texts from many languages. In this tutorial, we will be using German and English, so we define preprocessing steps for each language. The preprocessing, as defined below, tells  to: If you get errors running this command, make sure that you have downloaded English and German models for spacy. This is required since torchtext internally uses spacy to tokenize the text. We can now prepare the data by calling  on the  dataset, using the fields we have defined above.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"The idea is that, much like we multiply the ratio to a geometric sequence to calculate its sum, we can multiply terms to the Zeta function to factor out their multiples. For instance, let’s consider the case when we multiply  to the Zeta function. Since the Zeta function itself is an infinite series, we can subtract this result from the original Zeta function. This effectively filters or sieves out all terms whose denominator is a multiple of 2, effectively leaving only the odd terms. Concretely, If we repeat this process for all prime numbers, we will eventually be left with the following: where  denotes the set of all prime numbers. From this, we can come up with the following alternative representation of the Riemann Zeta function: which can also be expressed as Other than the fact that the factorization of the Riemann Zeta function is satisfying in and of itself, the result in (5) also provides us with an interesting probabilistic interpretation on coprimeness. The intuition is pretty simple: given some random natural number , the probability that a prime  will divide  is simply . For example, if we come up with some random number, the probability that 2 will divide that number (that the number is even) is 0.5; the probability that the number will be a multiple of 3 is one-thirds.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a famous problem in computer science. The problem might be summarized as follows: imagine you are a salesperson who needs to visit some number of cities. Because you want to minimize costs spent on traveling (or maybe you’re just lazy like I am), you want to find out the most efficient route, one that will require the least amount of traveling. You are given a coordinate of the cities to visit on a map. How can you find the optimal route? The most obvious solution would be the brute force method, where you consider all the different possibilities, calculate the estimated distance for each, and choose the one that is the shortest path. While this is a definite way to solve TSP, the issue with this approach is that it requires a lot of compute—the runtime of this brute force algorithm would be , which is just utterly terrible. In this post, we will consider a more interesting way to approach TSP: genetic algorithms. As the name implies, genetic algorithms somewhat simulate an evolutionary process, in which the principle of the survival of the fittest ensures that only the best genes will have survived after some iteration of evolutionary cycles across a number of generations. Genetic algorithms can be considered as a sort of randomized algorithm where we use random sampling to ensure that we probe the entire search space while trying to find the optimal solution.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"Then, we get With a very small bit of algebra, we end up with And there we have it, the value of ! It’s interesting to see how all this came out of the fourier series of . In this section, we will be taking a look at some interesting representations of the Basel problem, mysteriously packaged in integrals. At a glance, it’s somewhat unintuitive to think that an infinite summation problem can be stated as an integral in exact terms; however, the translation from summation to integrals are not out of the blue. Using things like Taylor series, it is in fact possible to show that the Basel problem can be stated as an integral. For instance, consider this integral One thing I am starting to realize these past few days is that some of these integrals are extremely difficult despite being deceptively simple in their looks. This is a good example. To get started, we might consider making a quick change of variables, namely . This will effectively get rid of the rather messy-looking denominator sitting in the fraction. To make further progress, at this point let’s consider the Taylor series expansion of . We can derive this by considering the following integral: since this integral evaluates to . One way to look at (10) would be to consider it as a sum of some geometric series whose first term begins with 1 and has a constant ratio of .

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","We can draw our own cumulative regret graph by first simulating what would have been the optimal result—in other words, we need to obtain the amount of reward the gambler would have earned had they simply pulled on the best bandit the entire time. Let’s quickly simulate that first. And it turns out that the maximum amount they would have earned, in this particular instance, is 74. I say in this particular instance, since the expected value of the maximum reward is simply 70, given that the highest success parameter is 0.7. This minor detail notwithstanding, we can now use the  quantity and the  list in order to recreate our own cumulative regret graph, as shown below.  It is obvious that the cumulative regret is highest when we start since the current reward is at 0. However, after some trial and error, the gambler starts to figure out which bandit is the best and starts pulling more of those, ultimately ending up at the point that is quite close to the maximum reward, though not quite due to the earlier opportunities that may have been lost due to exploration and sampling. In this post, we took a look at the multi-armed bandit problem and how it relates to Bayesian analysis with the Beta and Binomial distributions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Note that we can always generalize such quantities into moments. Given , the expected value of the Beta random variable can be expressed as Proving this is pretty straightforward if we simply use the law of the unconscious statistician. Using the definition of expectation, we can derive the following: Here, we use the Gamma representation of the Beta function. This conclusion gives an even nicer, more intuitive interpretation of the Bayesian update we saw earlier with the Beta prior and binomial likelihood. Namely, given the new posterior we know that sampling from that new posterior will give us a mean value that somewhat resembles the crude approach we would have taken without the prior expectation. Here, the crude approach is referring to the raw frequentist estimate we would have made had we not taken the Bayesian approach to the problem. It is obvious that the two hyperparameters of the prior are acting as an initial weight of sorts, making sure that when little data is available, the prior overshadows observations, but when ample amount of data is collected and available, eventually yields to those observations to estimate the parameter. Now we can turn our attention back to the multi-armed bandit problem. Now we can build on top of our knowledge of the Beta-Binomial update and refine what the frequentist greedy approach. We will also write out some simple functions to simulate the bandit problem and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian approach.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Notice that there is a 100-step cap, meaning if the drunkard was not able to find the restroom after a hundred steps, the trial was assumed a failure. We can verify the functionality of our design by calling the function. Cool! The Monte Carlo algorithm thus tells us that the probability of success is about 10 percent, which is a lot smaller thant I had personally anticipated. Think about how complicated it would have been to calculate this probability by hand. By simulating this game multiple times and counting the instances of successes, we can derive an estimation of the success rate of our particular random walk model. Let’s see what happens when we simulate the drunkard’s walk thirty times. In the particular instance that I have below, we see that the drunkard successfully reached the rest room four out of thirty attempts, which roughly equals the success probability of ten percent we saw earlier.  By now, hopefully you have been convinced that Monte Carlo is a wonderful method of solving problems. Although the examples we looked at were mostly simple, these algorithms can easily be applied to solve much harder ones. Simply put, Monte Carlo uses a brute force approach to simulate a particular instance of a model multiple times. Through such repeated sampling, we are able to gain a better understanding of the parameters underlying the issue at hand, no matter how complex.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"Considering the fact that there are a total of  possibilities, the fact that the algorithm was able to narrow it down to a plausible route that beats the baseline is still very interesting. Genetic algorithms belong to a larger group of algorithms known as randomized algorithms. Prior to learning about genetic algorithms, the word “randomized algorithms” seemed more like a mysterious black box. After all, how can an algorithm find an answer to a problem using pseudo-random number generators, for instance? This post was a great opportunity to think more about this naive question through a concrete example. Moreover, it was also interesting to think about the traveling salesman problem, which is a problem that appears so simple and easy, belying the true level of difficulty under the surface. There are many other ways to approach TSP, and genetic algorithms are just one of the many approaches we can take. It is also not the most effective way, as iterating over generations and generations can often take a lot of time.

A PyTorch Primer,"I’ve always been a fan of TensorFlow, specifically , for its simplicity and ease of use in implementing algorithms and building models. Today, I decided to give PyTorch a try.

Note that the majority of the code shown here are either borrowed from or are adaptations of those available on the PyTorch website, which is full of rich content and tutorials for beginners. Of course, basic knowledge of DL and Python would be helpful, but otherwise, it is a great place to start. Let’s dive right in!

To proceed further, observe that the first term is a constant that can escape out of the expectation: From the definition of variance and expectation, we know that Therefore, we can simplify (17) as follows: Let’s zoom in on the expected value term in (19). Our goal is to use (18) again so that we can flesh out another one half from that term. This can be achieved through some clever algebraic manipulation: But since the the expected value of  is constant and that of  is zero, We can now plug this simplified expression back into the calculation of KL divergence, in (19): Since we will standardize our input such that  and , we can plug these quantities into (22) and show that We are almost done with deriving the expression for ELBO.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Complex Fibonacci,"It is worth noting that the quantity in the parenthesis, namely is otherwise referred to as the Golden ratio. Also observe that the other quantity is the negative inverse of the Golden ratio. Let’s take a closer look at why the Binet’s formula makes sense. This is not going to be a rigorous proof or a derivation, but rather an attempt at cursory analysis to provide food for thought. This process was heavily referenced from this Quora post. Intuitively, Binet’s formula has to do with the well-known fact that the ratio between two consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden ratio as  goes to infinity. In this light, we might understand the fibonacci sequence as a geometric sequence with a constant ratio. The goal, then, is to show that the ratio is in fact the Golden ratio. Then, we have the following recurrence relation between consecutive terms. Dividing both sides by , we get This is a simple quadratic equation that we can easily solve. With some precalculus algebra, we get And indeed we start to see the Golden ratio and its negative inverse as solutions to the quadratic. This means that we can express the fibonacci sequence as a linear combinations of these two solutions: Much like solving any difference equations, we have two initial conditions, namely that , .

Word2vec from Scratch,"This aligns with the behavior we want, since we want the predicted probability to be as close to 1 as possible. So let’s summarize the entire process a little bit.

Overall, our model takes on the following structure: where  is the matrix contains the prediction probability vectors. With this in mind, let’s actual start building and train our model.

The representation we will use for the model is a Python dictionary, whose values are the weight matrices and keys, the name with which we will refer to the weight matrices. In accordance with the nomenclature established earlier, we stick with  and  to refer to these weights. Let’s specify our model to create ten-dimensional embeddings.

(Attempt at) Knowledge Distillation,"If you think about it, it kind of makes sense: given the shape of the digits, one would reasonably expect a 6 to look like 0, or vice versa, depending on the handwriting, and ditto the 9. Such implicit knowledge the model learns about the dataset is referred to as black knowledge. The goal of knowledge distillation is to be able to help the student model learn not only the true labels from the dataset, but also this dark knowledge that the larger teacher model has about the data. This is why we train the student model on the logits of the teacher model. There are several simplifications we’ve made so far in our explanation. One major simplification is how we treat the logits from the teacher model. If you look at the diagram above, the amount of dark knowledge that can be gained is relatively little. If the model is well-trained enough, perhaps it will predict the digit 6 with an even higher number of confidence, thus ascribing lesser probabilities to other labels like 0 or 9. So ironically, the better the teacher model is, the lesser dark knowledge there is to be gained by the student model. The authors circumvent this problem by adjusting the final softmax output of the teacher model. Recall that the softmax activation function looks as follows: Due to the nature of the exponential function, the softmax function is designed in such a way that larger logits are amplified, whereas smaller ones are squashed near zero.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
The Gibbs Sampler,"In order to use Gibbs sampling, we need to have access to information regarding the conditional probabilities of the distribution we seek to sample from.

We can only use the Gibbs sampler in a restricted context: namely, that we have access to conditional probability distributions. You quickly see why the Gibbs sampler can only be used in limited contexts. Nonetheless, when these set of information are available, it is a powerful algorithm with which we can sample from intractable distributions. Let’s see how this works. The gist of the Gibbs sampler is simple: sample from known conditional distributions, and use that resulting value to sample the next random variable from the following conditional probability distribution, ad infinitum. But this is just a lot of words and some needless Latin for fun and flair, so let’s hash out what the sentence really means. Continuing on from our generic example, let’s say we sampled a value from the first conditional probability distribution. We will use a superscript and subscript notation to each denote the iteration and the sequence of random variable. Assume that we start from some random -dimensional vector to start with.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Using this formula, let’s plot variance against the number of samples to see what effect increasing the sample size has on variance.

Now that we have this function ready, let’s use it to plot variance against the number of samples used in crude Monte Carlo integration  Notice that variance quickly converges to near zero as the number of samples gets larger! This means that, even if we do not know the true value of the integral expression, we can now be confident that the output of the crude Monte Carlo will have converged to an approximation of the true value with sampling size as big as 1000, or even something like 400. This gives us more confidence in saying that the integral expression in (1) is approximates to 0.247. The crude Monte Carlo algorithm we employed here used simple random sampling to generate a series of random numbers to be used for our estimation.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"In that post, we derived the formula for cross entropy and intuitively understood it as a way of measuring the “distance” between two distributions.

The logistic regression model will output a Bernoulli distribution, such as , which means that the given input has a 60 percent chance of belonging to class 1; 40 percent to class 0. Applying this to (3), we get: And that is the loss function we will use for logistic regression! The reason why we have two terms, one involving just  and another involving  is due to the structure of the Bernoulli distribution, which by definition can be written as Now that we have a loss function to work with, let’s build a function that computes cross entropy loss given  and  using (4).

Moments in Statistics,"Let’s start by simplifying the factorial in the denominator, and pulling out some expressions out of the sigma. where the third equality stands due to the variant of the Taylor series for the exponential function we looked at earlier: Therefore, we have confirmed that the mean of a Poisson distribution is equal to , which aligns with what we know about the distribution. Another way we can calculate the first moment of the Poisson is by deriving its MGF. This might sound a lot more complicated than just computing the expected value the familiar way demonstrated above, but in fact, MGFs are surprisingly easy to calculate, sometimes even easier than using the definition expectation. Let’s begin by presenting a statement of the MGF. Let’s factor out terms that contain lambda, which is not affected by the summation. Again, we refer to equation (9) to realize that the sigma expression simplifies into an exponential. In other words, From this observation, we can simplify equation (10) as follows: And there is the MGF of the Poisson distribution! All we have to do to obtain the first moment of the Poisson distribution, then, is to derive the MGF once and set  to 0.

Gaussian Process Regression,"Given any non-zero vector , The key takeaway is that, given some positive semi-definite matrix, we can easily factor it into what we might consider to be its square root in the form of . The Cholesky decomposition is extremely useful in the context of sampling. Recall that, in a univariate setting, we can model any normal distribution by simply sampling from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance: We can extend this simplle idea to the context of multivariate Gaussians. One natural complication, however, is that variance  is a matrix in a multivariate setting. Therefore, we would somehow have to find the standard deviation of the Gaussian, or effectively its square root. This is precisely where the Cholesky decomposition comes in handy. We will be using this means of sampling when implementing GP regression in the next section. Let’s put all the pieces together. The crux of GP regression is conditioning.

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Why dense vectors, then? Can’t we simply use one-hot encoding? That is a valid point, since one-hot encoding is how we mostly deal with categorical variables in a dataset. However, one downside of this approach is that we end up with many sparse vectors. In other words, a lot of resources are wasted because the model now has to process vectors of thousands or millions of dimensions, depending on the vocabulary size. Instead of using sparse vectors to represent each word, we can simply use a denser vector of smaller dimensions to encode our data. Another advantage of this approach is that dense vectors can be used to encode semantic information. You might have heard of the famous example that “king minus male equals queen minus female.” If we were to represent the words king, queen, male, and female as vectors, we can add and subtract vectors to represent and distill meaningful information. This vector-based computation is the key to natural language processing with deep neural networks: by back propagating and adjusting the weights of our embedding layer, our model can eventually be trained to “understand” the meaning of words and their relationship with other words in the form of dense vectors. Enough talking, let’s use the embedding layer to build our neural networks, starting with the simple feed-forward model.

However, because the result of a Bernoulli trial is binary, i.e. either a success or a failure, it cannot contain more than one success in unit time. Therefore, binary distribution cannot encode higher dimensions of information, such as two or three simultaneous successes in one trial. These set of complications motivate a new way of modeling phone calls. In the next section, we look at an alternate approach to the problem: the Poisson distribution. Here is some food for thought: what if we divide up unit time into infinitesimally small segments instead of the original ten, such that ? This idea is precisely the motivation behind the Poisson distribution. If we divide our time frame of interest into infinite segments, smaller even than microseconds, we can theoretically model multiple successful events, which is something that the binomial distribution could not account for. Intuitively speaking, this approach is akin to modeling a continuous function as infinitely many stepwise functions such that two “adjacent” dots on the graph could be considered as identical points—or, in probabilistic terms, a simultaneous event.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Word2vec from Scratch,"The first step, as is the approach taken in many NLP tasks, is to tokenize the text, i.e. splitting the text up into smaller units like words, getting rid of punctuations, and so on. Here is a function that does this trick using regular expressions. Let’s create tokens using the Wikipedia excerpt shown above. The returned object will be a list containing all the tokens in . Another useful operation is to create a map between tokens and indices, and vice versa. In a sense, we are creating a lookup table that allows us to easily convert from words to indices, and indices to words. This will be particularly useful later on when we perform operations such as one-hot encoding. Let’s check if the word-to-index and index-to-word maps have successfully been created. As we can see, the lookup table is a dictionary object containing the relationship between words and ids. Note that each entry in this lookup table is a token created using the  function we defined earlier. Now that we have tokenized the text and created lookup tables, we can now proceed to generating the actual training data, which are going to take the form of matrices. Since tokens are still in the form of strings, we need to encode them numerically using one-hot vectorization. We also need to generate a bundle of input and target values, as this is a supervised learning technique. This then begs the question of what the input and target values are going to look like.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now it’s finally time to put our Nietzsche model to the test. How we will do this is pretty simple. First, we will feed a 60-character excerpt from the text to our model. Then, the model will output a prediction vector, which is then passed onto  given a specified . We will finally have a prediction that is 1 character. Then, we incorporate that one character prediction into the original 60-character data we started with. We slice the new augmented data set from  to end up with another prediction. We would then slice the data set from, you guessed it,  and repeat the process as outlined above. When we iterate through this cycle many times, we would eventually end up with some generated text. Below is the  function that implements the iteration process. We’re almost done! To get a better sense of what impact temperature has on the generation of text, let’s quickly write up a  function that will allow us to generate text for differing values of . The time has come: let’s test our model for four different temperature values from 0.3 to 1.2, evenly spaced.

Gamma and Zeta,"The article also notes, however, that this definition only applies in a limited number of cases. This is because we’ve assumed, in using the summation of the geometric series formula, the fact that . Today’s post was a short yet very interesting piece on the relationship between the Gamma and the Riemann zeta. One thing I think could have been executed better is the depth of the article—for instance, what is the Bose integral and when is it used? I’ve read a few comments on the original YouTube video by blackpenredpen, where people were saying that the Bose integral is used in statistical mechanics and the study of black matter, but discussing that would require so much domain knowledge to cover. Regardless, I think the theoretical aspect of this derivation is interesting nonetheless. One thing I must do is writing a post on divergence and when the interchange of summation and integrals can be performed. I was originally planning to write a much longer article dividing deep into the Gamma and the Beta function as well as their distributions. However, I realized that what I need at this point in time is producing output and reorienting myself back to self-studying blogger mode, perhaps taking a brief hiatus from the grinding intern spending endless hours in Sublime text with Django (of course, I’m doing that because I enjoy and love the dev work).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now, all we have to do is to train the model with the data. Let’s run this for 50 epochs, just to give our model enough time to explore the loss function and settle on a good minimum. As I was training this model on Google Colab, I noticed that training even this simple model took a lot of time. Therefore, I decided that it is a good idea to probably save the trained model—in the worst case scenario that poor network connection suddenly caused the Jupyter kernel to die, saving a saved model file would be of huge help since I can continue training again from there. Saving the model on Google Colab requires us to import a simple module, . The process is very simple. To load the model, we can simply call the command below. Let’s take a look at the loss curve of the model. We can simply look at the value of the loss function as printed throughout the training scheme, but why not visualize it if we can?  As expected, the loss decreases throughout each epoch. The reason I was not paticularly worried about overfitting was that we had so much data to work with, especially in comparison with the relatively constrained memory capacity of our one-layered model.

As stated earlier in this post, the key behind word embeddings is that the rows of the first weight matrix is effectively a dense representation of one-hot encoded vectors each corresponding to various tokens in the text dataset. In our example, therefore, the embedding can simply be obtained by But of course, this is not a user-friendly way of displaying the embeddings. In particular, what we want is to be able to input a word through a function and receive as output the embedding vector for that given word. Below is a function that implements this feature. When we test out the word “machine,” we get a dense ten-dimensional vector as expected. And of course, this vector is not a collection of some randomly initialized numbers, but a result of training with context data generated through the sliding window algorithm described above. In other words, these vectors encode meaningful semantic information that tells us which words tend to go along with each other.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Principal Component Analysis,"How do we go about searching for multiple eigenvectors? This can be done, once again, with Lagrangians, with the added caveat that we will have more trailing terms in the end. Let’s elaborate on this point further. Here, we assume that we have already obtained the first component, , and our goal is to find the next component, . With induction, we can easily see how this analysis would apply to finding . Simply put, the goal is to maximize  under the constraint that  is orthogonal to  while also satisfying the constraint that it is a unit vector. (In reality, the orthogonality constraint is automatically satisfied since the covariance matrix is symmetric, but we demonstrate this nonetheless.) Therefore, Using Lagrangians, In the last equality, we make a trivial substitution to simplify and get rid of the constant. We also use the fact that the covariance matrix is symmetric. If we left multiply (18) by , But since , the first two terms go to zero. Also, the last term reduces to  since . This necessarily means that . If we plug this result back into (18), we end up with the definition of the eigenvector again, but this time for .

Fast Gradient Sign Method,"In today’s post, we will take a look at adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks have become an active field of research in the deep learning community, for reasons quite similar to why information security and cryptography are important fields in the general context of computer science. Adversarial examples are to deep learning models what viruses and malware are for computers. Of course, as is the case with any metaphor or parallel examples, these are simplifications to guide our intuition, not a robust one-to-one correspondence. This notebook was heavily adapted from the PyTorch official tutorial on adversarial example generation. I basically borrowed the model and weights from the tutorial to avoid having to create and train a model from scratch. Let’s get started! Before we jump into the implementation, let’s briefly go over what adversarial attacks are. In particular, we will be looking at one of the earliest methods of adversarial attack, known as the fast gradient sign method, or FGSM for short. FGSM was introduced in the paper Explaining and Harnesing Adversarial Examples, and has gained a lot of traction since. The paper isn’t the easiest, but it’s also not too difficult to follow. Here, I will try to present some details from the paper while not deviating too much from the bigger picture.

In many real-world cases, this process can be intractable, but because we are dealing with two Gaussian distributions, the property of conjugacy ensures that this problem is not only tractable, but also that the resulting posterior would also be Gaussian. Although this may not be immediately apparent, observe that the exponent is a quadratic that follows the form after making appropriate substitutions Therefore, we know that the posterior for  is indeed Gaussian, parameterized as follows: Let’s try to obtain the MAP estimate of of , i.e. simplify  Notice the similarity with the MLE estimate, which is the solution to normal equation, which I otherwise referred to as vanilla linear regression: This is no coincidence: in a previous post on MAP and MLE, we observed that the MAP and MLE become identical when we have a uniform prior.

Principal Component Analysis,"In this section, we will see how PCA is essentially a way of performing and applying these decomposition techniques under the hood. Recall that eigendecomposition is a method of decomposing matrices as follows: where  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and  is a matrix of eigenvectors. PCA is closely related to eigendecomposition, and this should come as no surprise. Essentially, by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of , we are performing an eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix: Notice that  is a matrix of principal components. Of course, in this case,  is a square matrix of full rank; to apply dimension compression, we need to slice the first  entries of . At any rate, it is clear that PCA involves eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. Eigendecomposition can only be applied to matrices of full rank. However, there is a more generalized method for non-square matrices, which is singular value decomposition. Here is a blueprint of SVD: Where  is a matrix containing the roots of the eigenvalues, with appropriate dimensional configurations to accommodate the shape of the original matrix. We cannot perform eigendecomposition on , which has no guarantee that it is square; however, SVD is definitely an option. Assume that  can be decomposed into , , and .

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"I have been putting off with blog postsings lately, largely because I was preoccupied with learning new languages I decided to pick up out of whim. Although I’m still learning the basics of these languages, namely HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I’m enjoying the process. I still have no idea where this spontaneous journey will take me, but hopefully I can make use of it in one way or another. The topic for today’s post is Monte Carlo methods, something that I have been very interested in for a long time, admittedly because of its eye-catching name. Contrary to my original expectation, Monte Carlo is not named after an eponymous mathematician, but a gambling hot spot in Monaco. The logic behind this nomenclature is that the simulation of random outcomes, such as in the context of an unpredictable gambling game, is what Monte Carlo methods are best suited for. To present a more formal definition, Monte Carlo methods refer to a broad category of  algorithms that use repeated random sampling to make estimations of unknown parameters. Basically, MC methods work by cleverly sampling from a distribution to estimate a variable of interest. This versatility is why MC method is such a powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. In today’s post, we will attempt to solve various bite-sized tasks using MC methods. These tasks will be of varying difficulty, but taken together, they will collectively demonstrate the useful applications of MC methods.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"An impotant observation to make is that, as we have noted earlier, User 6 and User 8 have rows that are identical.

Next, let’s see what  looks like. Shown above is the transpose of , which means that  is just really . What’s important here is that the five movies have also been reduced to three dimensions. We don’t really know what the columns of this matrix means; all we know is that it is some distillation and amalgamation of information about the ten users on some unknown axis. At any rate, the previous ten dimensional vectors have now been reduced to three dimensions, which is great news for us—as three dimensional beings, it’s always easier to visualize and deal with three dimensions or less than 10D. Movie 2 and Movie 3 do not look as similar as they did before on the ratings matrix.

Fisher Score and Information,"Although the derivation is by no means mathematically robust, it nonetheless vindicates a notion that is not necessary apparently obvious, yet makes a lot of intuitive sense in hindsight.

The gist of it is simple: if we consider the Hessian or the second derivative to be indicative of the curvature of the likelihood function, the variance of our estimate of the optimal parameter  would be larger if the curvature was smaller, and vice versa. In a sense, the larger the value of the information matrix, the more certain we are about the estimate, and thus the more information we know about the parameter.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"We could, for instance, tweak the Poisson distribution function and perform integration. The following is a code block that produces a visualization of what this integral would look like on a graph. Here is the figure produced by executing the code block above. You might notice from the code block that the integrand is not quite the Poisson distribution—instead of a factorial, we have an unfamiliar face, the  function. Why was this modification necessary? Recall that integrations can only be performed over smooth and continuous functions, hence the classic example of the absolute value as a non-integrable function. Factorials, unfortunately, also fall into this category of non-integrable functions, because the factorial operation is only defined for integers, not all real numbers. To remedy this deficiency of the factorial, we resort to the gamma function, which is essentially a continuous version of the factorial. Mathematically speaking, the gamma function satisfies the recursive definition of the factorial: Using the gamma distribution function, we can then calculate the area of the shaded region on the figure above. Although I do not present the full calculation process here, the value is approximately equal to that we obtained above, .

GAN in PyTorch,"In this blog post, we will be revisiting GANs, or general adversarial networks.

As always, we start by importing the necessary modules in PyTorch, as well as other libraries. Although we’ll be using CPU instead of GPUs, it’s always good to have a  object set up so that we can utilize GPUs should we run this script or notebook in a different environment. We’re not going to do anything too fancy (and I learned from experience that vanilla GANs are incredibly hard to train and can produce artifact-ridden results). Let’s keep in simple this time and try to implement a GAN that generates MNIST images. Below are the configurations we will use for our GAN. We can define a simple transformation that converts images to tensors, then applies a standard normalization procedure for easier training. Next, we create a dataset object and a data loader that batches and shuffles post-transformation images for us. You might recall that GANs are composed of two different networks: a discriminator and a generator.

The Exponential Family,"Although this is by no means a rigorous proof, we see not only the evident fact that the exponential distribution indeed belongs to the exponential family, but also that the factorization formula in (3) isn’t just a complete soup of equations and variables. We can do the same for the Bernoulli distribution, which also falls under the exponential family. The formula for the Bernoulli distribution goes as follows: Again, I have added a very simple indicator function to ensure that the the probability mass function is well-defined across the entire real number line. Again, the indicator function is a simple boolean gate function that checks whether  is an element within a set of zero and one: Factorizing the Bernoulli is slightly more difficult than doing the same for the exponential distribution, largely because it is not apparent from (9) how factorization can be achieved. For example, we do not see any exponential term embedded in (9) as we did in the case of the exponential distributions. Therefore, a simple one-to-one correspondence cannot be identified. The trick to get around this problem is to introduce a log transformation, then reapplying an exponential. In other words, By applying this manipulation, we can artificially create an exponential term to more easily coerce (9) into the factorization mold.

Gaussian Process Regression,"In this post, we will explore the Gaussian Process in the context of regression.

I highly recommend that you check out these resources, as they are both very beginner friendly and build up each concept from the basics. With that out of the way, let’s get started. Let’s begin by considering the classic setup of a regression problem. The goal of regression is to predict some values given a set of observations, otherwise referred to as a training set. There are of course many variants of the regression problem. For instance, in a previous post we took a look at Bayesian linear regression, where instead of a single point estimate, we tried to derive a distribution of the predicted data at a given test point. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are similar to Bayesian linear regression in that the final result is a distribution which we can sample from.

Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"In the last post, we revisited the Riemann Zeta function, which we had briefly introduced in another previous post on Euler’s take on the famous Basel problem.

In this post, we will explore an alternative way of solving the Basel problem using Fourier series expansion, and also discuss a alternative representations of the Basel problem in integral form. For the integral representations, I’m directly referencing Flammable Maths, a YouTube channel that I found both entertaining and informative. Let’s get started. First, let’s recall what the Basel problem is. The problem is quite simple: the goal is to obtain the value of an infinite series, namely This seems like an innocuous, straightforward problem. One can easily prove, for instance, the fact that this series converges using integral approximation. However, to obtain the value of this series is a lot more difficult than it appears—it is no coincidence that this problem remained unsolved for years until Euler came along. While there are many ways to solve this problem—Euler’s method, in particular, is one of the countless examples through which one can witness his amazing intuition and heuristic—but we will be using Fourier expansion to solve this problem, as it also provides a nice segue into the Dirichlet Eta function.

Moments in Statistics,"The word “moment” has many meanings. Most commonly, it connotes a slice of time. In the realm of physics, moment refers to the rotational tendency of some object, similar to how torque measures the change in an object’s angular momentum. As statisticians, however, what we are interested in is what moment means in math and statistics. In this post, we will attempt to shed new light on the topic of probability distributions through moment generating functions, or MGF for short. The mathematical definition of moments is actually quite simple. And of course, we can imagine how the list would continue: the th moment of a random variable would be . It is worth noting that the first moment corresponds to the mean of the distribution, . The second moment is related to variance, as . The third moment relates to the symmetry of the distribution, or the lack thereof, a quality which goes by the name of skewness. The fourth moment relates to kurtosis, which is a measure of how heavy the tail of a distribution is. Higher kurtosis corresponds to many outliers, while the converse would signify that the distribution contains little deviations. As you can see, the common theme is that the moment contains information about the defining features of a distribution, which is why it is such a convenient way to present information about a distribution.

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This visualization will help us see whether our model is actually learning with each epoch, and whether or not overfitting is occurring at any point in training.

These modifications involve shifting, zooming, and flipping. When we don’t have enough data to train our model on, using the  can be useful. Finally, let’s see how well our model performs!  The result shows that the model has learned decently well, with testing accuracy of approximately 80 percent.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"Recall that the simple, generic case of multivariate Taylor expansion looks as follows: This is simply a generalization of the familiar univariate Taylor series approximation we saw earlier.

Because there is obviously going to be sequential, temporal structure underlying the training data, we will use an LSTM layer, a type of advanced recurrent neural network we saw in the previous post. In fact, this is all we need, unless we want to create a deep neural network spanning multiple layers. However, training such a model would cost a lot of time and computational resource. For the sake of simplicity, we will build a simple model with a single LSTM layer. The output layer is going to be a dense layer with  number of neurons, activated with a softmax function.

PyTorch Tensor Basics,"As someone who prefers a more opinionated guideline, this was rather confusing at first. However, here is what I have gathered while sifting through Stack Overflow and PyTorch discussion forums. Let’s first start with a dummy random tensor.

For example, the snippet below shows how we can reshape  into a  tensor. One very important detail, however, is that this operation is not in-place. In other words, if we check the size of  again, you will realize that it is still a  tensor, as was originally initialized. To change  itself, we could do Or even better, we can use , which is an in-place operation by design. Notice that, unlike when we called ,  changes the tensor itself, in-place. In older versions of PyTorch,  existed as a non in-place operator. However, in newer versions of PyTorch, this is no longer the case, and PyTorch will complain with an informative deprecation error message. Note that  is not an in-place operator, meaning its behavior will largely be identical to that of . PyTorch keeps an internal convention when it comes to differentiating between in-place and copy operations. Namely, functions that end with a  are in-place operators. For example, one can add a number to a tensor in-place via , as opposed to the normal , which does not happen in-place.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Dissecting LSTMs,"In this post, we will revisit the topic of recurrent neural networks, or RNNs. Although we have used RNNs before in a previous post on character-based text prediction, we glossed over LSTM and assumed it as a black box that just worked. Today, we will take a detailed look at how LSTMs work by dissecting its components. Note that this post was inspired by this article by Kristiadi. I also heavily referenced this post by Christopher Olah. If you find any part of this article intriguing and intellectually captivating, you will surely enjoy reading their blogs as well. With this in mind, let’s jump right into it. Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, are one of the most widely used building blocks of Recurrent Neural Networks, or RNNs. This is because LSTMs overcame many of the limitations of basic vanilla RNNs: while simple RNN gates are bad at retaining long-term information and only remember input information that were fed into it relatively recently, LSTMs do a great job of retaining important information, even if they were fed into the cell long time ago.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","It’s time to put the methods we developed in the preceding sections to use for solving non-linear equations. Specifically, we’ll begin by taking look at a classic algorithm, the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is one of the many ways of solving non-linear equations. The intuition behind the Newton-Raphson method is pretty straightforward: we can use tangent lines to approximate the x-intercept, which is effectively the root of the equation . Specifically, we begin on some point on the graph, then obtain the tangent line on that point. Then, we obtain the -intercept of that tangent line, and repeat the process we’ve just completed by starting on a point on the graph whose -value is equal to that -intercept. The following image from Wikipedia illustrates this process quite well. (A digression: It’s interesting to see how “function” and “tangent” are written in German—in case you are wondering, I don’t know a word of German.)  Mathematically, the Newton-Raphson method can be expressed recursively as follows: Deriving this formula is quite simple. Say we start at a point on the graph, . The tangent line from that point will have a slope of . Therefore, the equation of the tangent line can be expressed as Then, the -intercept can simpy be obtained by finding an  value that which makes . Let  denote that point. Then, we arrive at the following update rule. Since we will be using  as the value for the next iteration, , and now we have the update rule as delineated in (4).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"The implication of this observation is that the trajectory expressed by the vector  is essentially that of a circle, with respect to time . More specifically, we see that at , , or , which means that the circle necessarily passes through the point  on the complex plane expressed as an Argand graph. From this analysis, we can learn that the trajectory is not just any circle, but a unit circle centered around the origin. But there’s even more! Recall that the velocity vector of the trajectory is a 90-degree rotation of the position vector, i.e. , . Earlier, we concluded that the trajectory expressed by the vector  is a unit circle, which necessarily means that  for all values of . Then, syllogism tells us that  is also one, i.e. the particle on the trajectory moves at unit speed along the unit circle! Now we finally have a full visualization of the position vector. The blue arrow represents the position vector at ; green, the velocity vector also at . Why is speed important? Unit speed implies that the particle moves by  distance units after  time units. Let’s say that  time units have passed. Where would the particle be on the trajectory now? After some thinking, we can convince ourselves that it would lie on the point , since the unit circle has a total circumference of . And so we have proved that , Euler’s identity. But we can also go a step further to derive the generalized version of Euler’s identity.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Word2vec from Scratch,"Now, we are finally ready to build and train our embedding network. At this point, you might be wondering how it is that training a neural network that predicts some nearby context word given an input token can be used to embed words into vectors. After all, the output of the network is going to be some probability vector that passed through a softmax layer, not an embedding vector. This is entirely correct, and this is a question that came to my mind as well. However, this is the part that gets the most interesting: the rows of the intermediate weight matrix is the embedding we are looking for! This becomes much more apparent once we consider the dimensions of the weight matrices that compose the model. For simplicity purposes, say we have a total of 5 words in the corpus, and that we want to embed these words as three-dimensional vectors. More specifically, here is the first weight layer of the model: A crucial observation to make is that, because the input is a sparse vector containing one-hot encoded vectors, the weight matrix effectively acts as a lookup table that moves one-hot encoded vectors to dense vectors in a different dimension—more precisely, the row space of the weight matrix. In this particular example, the weight matrix was a transformation of . This is exactly what we want to achieve with embedding: representing words as dense vectors, a step-up from simple one-hot encoding.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Convex Combinations and MAP,"In a previous post, we briefly explored the notion of maximum a posteriori and how it relates to maximum likelihood estimation. Specifically, we derived a generic formula for MAP and explored how it compares to that for MLE. Today’s post is going to be an interesting sequel to that story: by performing MAP on the univariate Gaussian, we will show how MAP can be interpreted as a convex combination, thus motivating a more intuitive understanding of what MAP actually entails under the hood. Let’s jump right into it. The univariate Gaussian is a good example to work with because it is simple and intuitive yet also complex enough for meaningful analysis. After all, it is one of the most widely used probability distributions and also one that models many natural phenomena. With that justification firmly in mind, let’s take a look at the setup of the MAP of the  mean for the univariate Gaussian. As always, we begin with some dataset of  independent observations. In this case, because we are dealing with the univariate Gaussian, each observations will simply be a scalar instead of a vector. In other words, Let’s assume that the random variable is normally distributed according to some parameter . We will assume that the standard deviation of the random variable is given as . We could have considered standard deviation to be a parameter, but since the goal of this demonstration is to conduct MAP estimation on the mean of the univariate Gaussian, we assume that the standard deviation is known.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"First, note that our model accepts input of size . The dimensionality of the output is a little more tricky because of the  option. What concatenate does is that it basically flattens all  number of outputs into a single list. In this case, because we set the option to , we get a flattened list containing , or 6400 elements. The main takeaway is that recurrent neural networks can be used to implement some sort of memory functionality, which is useful when dealing with datasets where there exists some sort of sequential structure. One way to implement memory is by using the output of the previous sequence to define a  variable, which is used to compute the next output as we have done above. Now let’s get down to business with the  API. Implementing a recurrent neural network is not so much different from building a simple feed forward or convolutional neural network: we simply import a RNN-specific layer and arrange these layers to construct a working model. Before we proceed any further, let’s first import all necessary dependencies for this tutorial. As with any tutorial, we need to start by loading and preprocessing data. Luckily, there isn’t going to be much preprocessing involved since we will be using a dataset available from the  library, the IMBD movie reviews dataset. The dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled as either positive or negative. Each review is encoded as a sequence of integers according to a consistent encoding scheme.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Bayesian Linear Regression,"MAP versus MLE is a recurring theme that appears throughout the paradigmatic shift from frequentist to Bayesian, so it merits discussion. Now that we have a posterior distribution for  which we can work with, it’s time to derive the predictive distribution. We go about this by marginalizing  using the property of conditional probability, as illustrated below. This may seem like a lot, but most of it was simple calculation and distributing vectors over parentheses. It’s time to use the power of conjugacy again to extract a normal distribution out of the equation soup. Let’s complete the square of the exponent according to the Gaussian form after making the appropriate substitutions Again, observing this is not a straightforward process, especially if we had no idea what the final distribution is going to look like. However, given that the resulting predictive posterior will take a Gaussian form, we can backtrack using this knowledge to obtain the appropriate substitution parameters in (13). Continuing, where the last equality stands because we can pull out terms unrelated to  by considering them as constants. Why do we bother to pull out the exponent? This is because the integral of a probability density function evaluates to 1, leaving us only with the exponential term outside the integral. To proceed further from here, let’s take some time to zoom in on  for a second. Substituting , we get We can now plug this term back into (15) as shown below.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"In a previous post on likelihood, we explored the concept of maximum likelihood estimation, a technique used to optimize parameters of a distribution. In today’s post, we will take a look at another technique, known as maximum a posteriori estimation, or MAP for short. MLE and MAP are distinct methods, but they are more similar than different. We will explore the similar mathematical underpinnings behind the methods to gain a better understanding of how distributions can be tweaked to best fit some given data. Let’s begin! Before we jump right into comparing MAP and MLE, let’s refresh our memory on how maximum likelihood estimation worked. Recall that likelihood is defined as In other words, the likelihood of some model parameter  given data observations  is equal to the probability of seeing  given . Thus, likelihood and probability are inevitably related concepts that describe the same landscape, only from different angles. The objective of maximum likelihood estimation, then, is to determine the values for a distribution’s parameters such that the likelihood of observing some given data is maximized under that distribution. In the example in the previous post on likelihoods, we showed that MLE for a normal distribution is equivalent to setting  as the sample mean; , sample variance. But this convenient case was specific only to the Gaussian distribution.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"The  function below is an implementation of back propagation that encapsulates equations (14) through (17). There is a subtlety that I did not discuss previously, which has to do with the bias terms. It may appear as if the gradient of the bias term does not match that of the bias term itself. Indeed, that is a valid observation according to equation (16). The way we go about this is that we add up the elements of the matrix according to columns. This is exactly what we do with the  command invoked when computing  and , which represent the gradient of the bias terms. With all the complex math behind, here is the code implementation of back propagation. Finally, our model is ready to be trained! Here is a simple function which we can use to train and test our model. Because each iteration can yield a different accuracy, we repeat the experiment multiple times—or specifically,  times—to obtain the mean accuracy of our model. We also get a standard deviation of the mean accuracy estimate to see whether or not the performance of the model is reliable and consistent. Let’s test our model with the  and  data, with batch size set to 10. The mean accuracy of our model is around 95 percent, which isn’t bad for a simple neural network with just two layers. The standard deviation is also reasonably low, indicating that the performance of our model is consistent with little variations.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
Gaussian Process Regression,"This is where I think GPs get really interesting: the key point of GP is to realize that we want to model some smooth function that best fits our data. What does this “smoothness” mean in terms of covariance? The answer is that  values that are close to each other must be highly correlated, whereas those that are far apart would have low covariance. In other words, knowing the value of  tells us a lot about the value of , whereas it tells us very little about the value of . In short, the closer the values, the higher the covariance. So at the end of the day, all there is to GP regression is to construct this covariance matrix using some distance function. In GPs, these covariance matrices are referred to as kernels. Kernels can be understood as some sort of prior that we impose upon the regression problem. The idea of smoothness noted earlier is one such example of a prior. But it is a general prior that makes a lot of sense, since we normally don’t want stepwise or non-differential functions as the result of regression. But there are hundreds and thousands of kernels out there that each suit different purposes. For the sake of simplicity, however, we will only take a look at one such kernel that relates to smoothness: the squared exponential kernel, often referred to as the RBF kernel.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Complex Fibonacci,"A simple hack that nonetheless makes a lot of sense in this case is to use the real-number line for two purposes: representing the input dimension, namely the real number line, and one component of the output dimension—the real number portion of the output to Binet’s formula. This admittedly results in a loss of information, since finding the point where  won’t give us the th fibonacci number; instead, it will only tell us what the fibonacci number is whose real number component equals . Nonetheless, this is an approach that makes sense since the real number line is a common dimension in both the input and output data. With this in mind, let’s go ahead and try to plot the interpolation of the fibonacci sequence on the complex plane. First, we import the modules we will need. Then, we simply specify the domain on the real number line and generate the fibonacci numbers, separating out the real and imaginary components. Note that  is not going to be used for plotting; instead, we use  as the -axis, and this is where the loss of temporal information comes in, as mentioned earlier. Now, let’s go ahead and plot it out!  And there it is, the full fibonacci sequence, interpolated across the real numbers. When I first saw this pattern in Matt Parker’s video, I was simply in awe, a loss of words. There’s something inexplicably beautiful and wonderful at this pattern, almost as if it was some part of God’s plan.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Having a uniform prior only makes sense on the very first try, when there is no historical data to estimate the parameter from. However, once we start pulling the lever and seeing the results of each consecutive pull, we should be able to build some prior expectation as to what the true value of the parameter is. This suggests that the uniform prior approach is missing some important key pieces. To really drive this point home, let’s discuss more about the notion of conjugate priors, specifically in the context of the Beta and binomial distributions. The notion of conjugate priors is something that recurs extremely often in Bayesian analysis. This is mainly because conjugate priors offer a nice closed-form solution to posterior distribution computation. Simply put, a conjugate prior to some likelihood function is a type of prior that, when multiplied with a given likelihood, produces a posterior distribution that is of the same form as itself. For example, a Beta prior, when multiplied with a binomial likelihood, produces a Beta posterior. This is what we want in Bayesian analysis, since we can now assume that posterior to be our new prior in the next iteration of experiments. In this section, we will build on top of this high level understanding of conjugacy to show that a Beta distribution is indeed a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function. On that end, let’s start with a quick definition review of the Beta distribution and the Beta function.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"While genetic algorithms are not the most efficient or guaranteed method of solving TSP, I thought it was a fascinating approach nonetheless, so here goes the post on TSP and genetic algorithms. Before we dive into the solution, we need to first consider how we might represent this problem in code. Let’s take a look at the modules we will be using and the mode of representation we will adopt in approaching TSP. The original, popular TSP requires that the salesperson return to the original starting point destination as well. In other words, if the salesman starts at city A, he has to visit all the rest of the cities until returning back to city A. For the sake of simplicity, however, we don’t enforce this returning requirement in our modified version of TSP. Below are the modules we will be using for this post. We will be using , more specifically a lot of functions from  for things like sampling, choosing, or permuting.  arrays are also generally faster than using normal Python lists since they support vectorization, which will certainly be beneficial when building our model. For reproducibility, let’s set the random seed to 42. Now we need to consider the question of how we might represent TSP in code. Obviously, we will need some cities and some information on the distance between these cities. One solution is to consider adjacency matrices, somewhat similar to the adjacency list we took a look at on the post on Breadth First and Depth First Search algorithms.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Time and again, I realize that there is an element of intuitiveness to Bayesian statistics that, though not obvious at first, starts to make more sense as I explore more into that realm. Of course, frequentist statistics offers a quick and easy way of interpreting certain metrics, but the notion of expectation is something that I had thought was complicated and unnecessary at first, but have gradually come to understand, embrace, and even support. Perhaps writing this post has reaffirmed my Bayesian identity as a budding statistician. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this post. Catch you up in the next one!.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"In other words, the prior would appear to be a uniform distribution, which is really a specific instance of a Beta distribution with . Presented below is a code snippet that simulates 500 coin flips, throughout which we perform five calculations to update our posterior. Executing this code block produces the following figure. This plot shows us the change in our posterior distribution that occurs due to Bayesian update with the processing of each data chunk. Specifically, we perform this Bayesian update after  trials. When no coin flips are performed, as shown in the first subplot, the prior follows a uniform distribution as detailed above. As more coin tosses are performed, however, we start to develop an understanding of the fairness of the coin. When we only have a few data points, the more probability there is that we obtain skewed data, which is why the mean estimate of our posterior seems skewed as well. However, with a larger number of trials, the law of large numbers guarantees that we will eventually be able to identify the value of our parameter , which is indeed the case. The key takeaway from this code block is the line . This is all the Bayesian method there is in this updating procedure.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The underlying idea is that, given some data with  feature columns, we can derive a probability distribution for the label for that intance. The naive assumption that the naive Bayes classifier makes—now you can guess where that name comes from—is that each of the  variables in the instance vector are independent of one another. In other words, knowing a value for one of the features does not provide us with any information about the values for the other  feature columns. Combining this assumption of independence with Bayes’ theorem, we can now restate (1) as follows: Pretty straight forward. We know that the demominator, which often goes by the name “evidence” in Bayesian inference, is merely a normalizing factor to ensure that the posterior distribution integrates to 1. So we can discard this piece of information and distill (2) down even farther: Equation (3) tells us that it is possible to calculate the probability of instance  belonging to class  systematically. Why is this important? The simple answer is that we can use (3) to train the naive Bayes classifier. Say we know that for a particular instance , the label is . Then, we have to find the distribution for each feature such that we can maximize . Does this ring any bells? Yes—it is maximum a posteriori estimation! In other words, our goal would be to maximize the posterior distribution for each training instance so that we can eventually build a model that would output the most likely label that the testing instance belongs to.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
The Gibbs Sampler,"In this post, we will explore Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm used for sampling from probability distributions, somewhat similar to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm we discussed some time ago. MCMC has somewhat of a special meaning to me because Markov chains was one of the first topics that I wrote about here on my blog. It’s been a while since I have posted anything about math or statistics-related, and I’ll admit that I’ve been taking a brief break from these domains, instead working on some personal projects and uping my Python coding skills. This post is going to be a fun, exciting mesh of some Python and math. Without further ado, let’s get started. I remember struggling to understand Metropolis-Hastings a while back. Gibbs sampling, on the other hand, came somewhat very naturally and intuitively to me. This is not because I’ve suddenly grown intelligent over the past couple of months, but because Gibbs sampling is conceptually simpler, at least in my humble opinion. All that is necessary to understand Gibbs sampling is the notion of conditional probability distributions. We know the classic context in which MCMC comes into play in a Bayesian setting: there is some intractable distribution that we wish to sample from. Metropolis-Hastings was one simple way to go about this, and Gibbs sampling provides another method. A feature that makes Gibbs sampling unique is its restrictive context.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Introduction to tf-idf,"The motivation behind tf-idf commences from a simple question: how do we determine the semantic importance of a word in a set of documents? On one hand, words the appear a lot are probably worth paying attention to. For example, in one of my posts on Gaussian distributions, the word “Gaussian” probably appears many times throughout the post. A keyword probably appears frequently in the document; hence the need to calculate tf. On the other hand, there might be words that appear a lot, but aren’t really that important at all. For example, consider the word “denote.” I know that I use this word a lot before writing down equations or formulas, just for the sake of notational clarity. However, the word itself carries little information on what the post is about. The same goes for other words, such as “example,” “however,” and so on. So term frequency only doesn’t really tell us much; instead, we want to pay attention to words that occur frequently in a given document, but doesn’t appear a lot in others—such words are most likely to be unique keywords that potentially capture the gist of that document. Given this analysis, it isn’t difficult to see why tf-idf is designed the way it is. Although we give priority weight to words with high term frequency, we discount words that appear frequently across all documents by dividing tf by idf, or inverse document frequency.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
So What are Autoencoders?,"Now that the autoencoder model is fully ready, it’s time to see what it can do! Although autoencoders present countless exciting possibilities for application, we will look at a relatively simple use of an autoencoder in this post: denoising. There might be times when the photos we take or image data we use are tarnished by noise—undesired dots or lines that undermine image quality. An autoencoder can be trained to remove these noises fairly easily as we will see in thi post. First, let’s import the MNIST data set for this tutorial. Nothing much exciting is happening below, except for the fact that we are rearranging and preprocessing the dataset so as to maximize training efficiency. Next, we will add  noise to the data. Note that the MNIST dataset does not contain noise by default: we will have to artificially and intentionally tarnish the dataset to produce a noisy training set for the autoencoder model. The  function precisely performs this function. Using the  function, we can create a noisy sample. Note that  was set to 0.5, although I’d imagine other values within reasonable range would work equally well as well. Training the model is very simple: the training data is , the noisy dataset, and the predicted label is .

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"For example, we can calculate the gradient with respect to the weights of the second affine layer as follows: We won’t get into much mathematical details here, but a useful intuition we can use to derive equation (15) is to pay close attention to the dimensionality of data. Note that the dimension of the gradient as a matrix should equal to that of the layer itself. In other words, , so on and so forth. This is because the purpose of gradient computation is to update the matrix of parameters: to perform an element-by-element update with the gradient, it must necessarily be true that the dimensionality of the gradient equals that of the original matrix. Using this observation, it is possible to navigate through the confusion of transposes and left, right matrix multiplication that one might otherwise encounter if they were to approach it without any intuition or heuristics. To expedite this post, I’ll present the result of the gradient calculations for all parameters below.

For a brief introductory overview of RNNs, I recommend that you check out this previous post, where we explored not only what RNNs are and how they work, but also how one can go about implementing an RNN model using Keras.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"In other words, it contains 4 feature columns—the width and length of sepals and petals, as mentioned earlier—and 30 observation of iris plants.

The returned numpy array contains the class labels for each of the thirty observations in the  matrix.

But there are some samples that our KNN algorithm missed, such as the 27th data point: although its actual label is 2, our model predicted it to be 1. We can mathematically calculate the accuracy of our model by using the following function. The job of this function is quite simple: it goes through the two lists, element by element, and checks if the two values are identical. See the implementation below. The accuracy of our prediction turns out to be about 97 percent. But can we do better? Recall that we arbitrarily chose  to be 10 when we initialized the KNN algorithm.

While the numbers might look like they came out of nowhere, it’s actually just a reversal of the operation above. Specifically, given a normalizing operation we can undo this normalization via In other words, the reverse transformation can be summarized as And thus it is not too difficult to derive the values specified in the reverse transformation .

It looks nice, simple, and concise, but what does it mean to say that the expected value of the sufficient statistic is the average of the sufficient statistic for each observed individual data points? To remove  abstractness, let’s employ a simple example, the exponential distribution, and attempt to derive a clearer understanding of the final picture. Recall that the probability density function of the exponential distribution takes the following form according to the factorizations outlined below: Computing the derivative of the log of the normalizing term  as we did in (22), Because we know that the resulting quantity is the expected value of the sufficient statistic, we know that And indeed, this is true: the expected value of the random variable characterized by an exponential distribution is simply the inverse of the parameter defining that distribution. Note that the parameter for the exponential distribution is most often denoted as , in which case the expected value of the distribution would simply be written as .

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"If we temporarily disregard the constants that show up in (6), we can conveniently trim down the equation for Bayesian inference as follows: This idea is not totally alien to us—indeed, this is precisely the insight we gleaned from the example of the potential patient. This statement is also highly intuitive as well. The posterior probability would be some mix of our initial belief, expressed as a prior, and the data newly presented, the likelihood. Bayesian inference, then, can be understood as a procedure for incorporating prior beliefs with evidence in order to derive an updated posterior. What makes Bayesian inference such a powerful technique is that the derived posterior can themselves be used as a prior for subsequent inference conducted with new data. To see Bayesian inference in action, let’s dive into the most classic, beaten-to-death yet nonetheless useful example in probability and statistics: the coin flip. This example was borrowed from the following post. Assume that we have a coin whose fairness is unknown. To be fair, most coins are approximately fair (no pun intended) given the physics of metallurgy and center of mass, but for now let’s assume that we are ignorant of coin’s fairness, or the lack thereof. By employing Bayesian inference, we can update our beliefs on the fairness of the coin as we accumulate more data through repeated coin flips. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that each coin flip is independent of others, i.e. the coin flips are independent and identically distributed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Perhaps we should scale this in terms of relative distances or plot it on a three dimensional space, which is exactly what we are going to in a moment. Before we jump into visualizations, however, let’s deal with the elephant in the room first: is it okay to simply chop off a few dimensions to reduce a high dimensional image to fit into three-dimensional space? To answer this question, let’s check the  matrix for this particular instance of singular value decomposition. Note that we already have the first three values of  in our hands given that  in our instantiation of singular value decomposition. The information we lose pertains to the last two values, given by  and . These values are smaller in order of magnitude compared to, for instance, the largest value of , which is . This supports the idea that the information we lose amid dimensionality reduction is minimal. Alternatively, we can also see this by taking a look at the full, unreduced version of the matrix  or . For example, the code snippet below displays the full version of the factor . It is not difficult to see that the last few columns of  contain values so small that their contribution to data is going to be minimal at best. This is not the most mathematical way of presenting the concept of data—doing so would require us to take a look at other metrics such as covariance—but this basic analysis will suffice for our purposes for now.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","At this point, it is perhaps necessary to remind ourselves of why we went down the matrix calculus route in the first place. The intuition behind this approach was that we can construct an expression for the total error given by the regression line, then derive that expression to find the values of the parameters that minimize the error function. Simply put, we will attempt to frame linear regression as a simple optimization problem. Let’s recall the problem setup from the linear algebra section above. The problem, as we framed it in linear algebra terms, went as follows: given some unsolvable system of equations , find the closest approximations of  and , each denoted as  and  respectively, such that the system is now solvable. We will start from this identical setup with the same notation, but approach it slightly differently by using matrix calculus. The first agenda on the table is constructing an error function. The most common metric for error analysis is mean squared error, or MSE for short. MSE computes the magnitude of error as the squared distance between the actual value of data and that predicted by the regression line. We square the error simply to prevent positive and negative errors from canceling each other out. In the context of our regression problem, where  denotes the error function.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Based on prior knowledge, we would expect to find the local maximum at , as this is where the bell curve peaks. If we were to dig a bit deeper into prior knowledge, we would expect the point of inflection to be one standard deviations away from the mean, left and right. Let’s verify if these are actually true. From good old calculus, we know that we can obtain the local extrema by setting the first derivative to zero. We can ignore the constants as they are non-zero. Then, we end up with Because the exponent is always positive, the only way for the expression to evaluate to zero is if This tells us that the local maximum of the univariate Gaussian occurs at the mean of the distribution, as we expect. The inflection point can be obtained by setting the second order derivative of the probability distribution function equal to zero. Luckily, we’re already halfway done with calculating the second order derivative since we’ve already computed the first order derivative above. As we have done above, let’s ignore the constants since they don’t affect the calculation. Because the first exponential term cannot equal zero, we can simplify the equation to Therefore, From this, we can see that the inflection point of the univariate Gaussian is exactly one standard deviation away from the mean. This is one of the many interesting properties of the normal distribution that we can see from the formula for the probability distribution.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Fast Gradient Sign Method,"Then, we can create an adversarial example via This is the crux of the fast gradient sign method: we use the sign of the gradient, multiply it by some small value, and add that perturbation to the original input to create an adversarial example. One way to look at this is in terms of first-order approximation. Recall that In this context, we can consider  to be the cost function , which then turns into Then, the goal of an adversarial attack is to maximize the second term in the addition. Since there is an infinity norm constraint on the perturbation, namely with some thinking we can convince ourselves that the perturbed example that maximizes the loss function is given by Let’s import some modules, download and process MNIST data, and declare a model on which to perform an adversarial attack. These are all routine operations, so I’ll drop a lot of the explanation. Below is a tody convolutional neural network model designed to classify MNIST handwritten digits. We load the model and put it into evaluation mode, since we won’t be updating the weights of the model. Since we want to create perturbations for each image, we need to set the batch size to be one.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"And as we obtain larger quantities of data, the relative importance of the prior distribution starts to diminish. Imagine that we have an infinite number of data points. Then,  will soley be determined by the likelihood function, as the weight ascribed to the prior will decrease to zero. In other words, Conversely, we can imagine how having no data points at all would cause the weight values to shift in favor of the prior such that no importance is ascribed to the MLE estimate of the parameter. In this short article, we reviewed the concept of maximum a posteriori and developed a useful intuition about its result from the perspective of convex combinations. Maximum a posteriori, alongside its close relative maximum likelihood estimation,  is an interesting topic that deserives our attention. Hopefully through this post, you gained a better understanding of what the result of an MAP estimation actually means from a Bayesian point of view: a weighted average between the prior mean and the MLE estimate, where the weight is determined by the number of data points at our disposal. Also, I just thought that the name “convex conbinations” is pretty cool. The fancier the name, the more desire to learn—it is a natural human instinct indeed. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"To cut to the chase, we get And there we have it, the relationship between the Dirichlet Eta function and the Riemann Zeta function! There are many more interesting things about the Eta function, such as its convergence property, but that is a topic for another post. In this post, we developed an intuition for the implications of the Riemann Zeta function from the perspective of relative primeness and probability. The Zeta function is one of those things in mathematics that appear so simple on the surface, yet is so wonderfully complex and convoluted in the inside. Although we haven’t discussed these other intricacies of the Riemann Zeta function—in particular, its relationship to the Riemann hypothesis, which states that the Zeta function has roots at negative even integers and complex numbers whose real part is —but the approach we took here with prime numbers are probabilities is fascinating in its own right, providing ample food for thought. Many thanks to Chris Henson again for the code and the post. It’s always a lot of fun to mesh mathematics with programming, and I think this is why I enjoyed writing this post.

Understanding the  Leibniz Rule,"As simple as it seems, we can in fact analyze Leibniz’s rule by applying this definition, as shown below: Thus we have shown that, if the limits of integration are constants, we can switch the order of integration and differentiation. But because our quench for knowledge is insatiable, let’s consider the more general case as well: when the limits are not bounded by constant, but rather functions. Specifically, the case we will consider looks as follows. In this case, we see that  and  are each functions of variable . With some thinking, it is not difficult to convince ourselves that this will indeed introduce some complications that require modifications to our original analysis. Now, not only are we slightly moving the graph of  in the  axis, we are also shifting the limits of integration such that there is a horizontal shift of the area box in the  axis. But fear not, let’s apply the same approach to answer this question. This may appear to be a lot of computation, but all we’ve done is just separating out the integrals while paying attention to the domains of integration. Let’s continue by doing the same for the remaining terms. The first two terms in the limit go away since  goes to zero. While the same applies to the fractional terms, one difference is that they are also divided by , which is why they remain.

Likelihood and Probability,"“I think that’s very unlikely.” “No, you’re probably right.” These are just some of the many remarks we use in every day conversations to express our beliefs. Linguistically, words such as “probably” or “likely” serve to qualify the strength of our professed belief, that is, we express a degree of uncertainty involved with a given statement. In today’s post, I suggest that we scrutinize the concept of likelihood—what it is, how we calculate it, and most importantly, how different it is from probability. Although the vast majority of us tend to conflate likelihood and probability in daily conversations, mathematically speaking, these two are distinct concepts, though closely related. After concretizing this difference, we then move onto a discussion of maximum likelihood, which is a useful tool frequently employed in Bayesian statistics. Without further ado, let’s jump right in. As we have seen in an earlier post on Bayesian analysis, likelihood tells us—and pardon the circular definition here—how likely a certain parameter is given some data. In other words, the likelihood function answers the question: provided some list of observed or sampled data , what is the likelihood that our parameter of interest takes on a certain value ? One measurement we can use to answer this question is simply the probability density of the observed value of the random variable at that distribution. In mathematical notation, this idea might be transcribed as: At a glance, likelihood seems to equal probability—after all, that is what the equation (1) seems to suggest.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Gamma and Zeta,"This means that , using which we can establish the following: With some algebraic implications, we end up with Dividing both sides by , we get All the magic happens when we cast a summation on the entire expression: Notice that now we have the Riemann zeta function on the left hand side. All we have to do is to clean up what is on the right. As it stands, the integral is not particularly tractable; however, we can swap the integral and the summation expression to make progress. I still haven’t figured out the details of when this swapping is possible, which has to do with absolute divergence, but I will be blogging about it in the future once I have a solid grasp of it, as promised before. The expression in the parentheses is just a simple sum of geometric series, which we know how to calculate. Therefore, we obtain To make this integral look more nicer into a form known as the Bose integral, let’s multiply both the numerator and the denominator by . After some cosmetic simplifications, we end up with Putting everything together, now we have derived a nice expression that places both the Riemann zeta and the Gamma functions together: Or, alternatively, a definition of the Riemann zeta in terms of the Gamma: And indeed, with (13), we can evaluate the Riemann zeta function at non-integer points as well.

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"In recursive form, this statement can be expressed as follows: The math-inclined thinkers in this room might consider the possibility of conducting an eigendecomposition on the stochastic matrix to simply the calculation of matrix powers. There is merit to considering this proposition, although later on we will see that this approach is inapplicable to the current case. Eigendecomposition refers to a specific method of factorizing a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let’s begin the derivation: let  be the matrix of interest,  a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of , and , a matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding eigenvalues of . Let’s consider the result of multiplying  and . If we view multiplication as a repetition of matrix-times-vector operations, we yield the following result. But recall that  are eigenvectors of , which necessarily implies that Therefore, the result of  can be rearranged and unpacked in terms of : 
 In short, Therefore, we have , which is the formula for eigendecomposition of a matrix. One of the beauties of eigendecomposition is that it allows us to compute matrix powers very easily. Concretely, Because  and  nicely cross out, all we have to compute boils down to !

BLEU from scratch,"corresponds to ;  corresponds to . Using this modified metric, we can see that the  is now penalized quite a lot through the clipping mechanism. But there are still problems that modified precision doesn’t take into account. Consider the following example translation. To us, it’s pretty obvious that  is a bad translation. Although some of the key words might be there, the order in which they are arranged violates English syntax. This is the limitation of using unigrams for precision analysis. To make sure that sentences are coherent and read fluently, we now have to introduce the notion of n-grams, where  is larger than 1. This way, we can preserve some of the sequential encoding in reference sentences and make better comparison. The fact that unigrams are a poor way of evaluating translations becomes immediately clear once we plot the  in n-grams against modified precision.  As you can see, precision score decreases as  gets higher. This makes sense: a larger  simply means that the window of comparison is larger. Unless whole phrases co-occur in the translation and reference sentences—which is highly unlikely—precision will be low. People have generally found that a suitable  value lies somewhere around 1 and 4. As we will see later, packages like  use what is known as cumulative 4-gram BLEU score, or BLEU-4. The good news is that our current implementation is already able to account for different  values. This is because we wrote a handy little function, .

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"For example,  does not reflect the fact that getting a 1 on a roll of the dice will move the player up to the thirty eighth cell; it supposes that the player would stay on the first cell.

Now that we have a concrete matrix to work with, let’s start by identifying its eigenvectors.

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"GRU is probably not fair game for our simple RNN, but let’s see how well it does. Let’s declare the model and an optimizer to go with it. Notice that we are using a two-layer GRU, which is already one more than our current RNN implementation. The training appeared somewhat more stable at first, but we do see a weird jump near the end of the second epoch. This is partially because I didn’t use gradient clipping for this GRU model, and we might see better results with clipping applied. Let’s see the accuracy of this model. And we get an accuracy of around 80 percent for this model. This is better than our simple RNN model, which is somewhat expected given that it had one additional layer and was using a more complicated RNN cell model. Let’s see how this model predicts given some raw name string. The last one is interesting, because it is the name of a close Turkish friend of mine. The model obviously isn’t able to tell us that the name is Turkish since it didn’t see any data points that were labeled as Turkish, but it tells us what nationality the name might fall under among the 18 labels it has been trained on.

My First GAN,"For this tutorial, we will be using images of ships, which are labeled as 8. So let’s go ahead and specify that. We see that  contains 6000 images, which is more than enough to start training our GAN. To train the GAN, we will define a  function. Essentially, this function creates binary labels for real and fake images. Recall that the goal of the discriminator is to successfully discern generated images from real ones. Also recall that to create generated images, the generator needs to sample from a latent dimension. In other words, training will consist of the following steps: These high level abstractions are what  implements behind the scenes. There are several subtleties that deserve our attention. First, we fade out the labels ever so slightly to expedite the training process. These are little magic tricks that people have found to work well on GAN training. While I’m not entirely sure about the underlying principle, it most likely comes from the fact that having a smooth manifold is conducive to the training of a neural network. Second, coercing a true label on the GAN essentially trains the generator. Note that we never explicitly address the generator in the function; instead, we only train the discriminator. By coercing a true label on the GAN, we are effectively forcing the generator to produce more compelling images, and penalizing it when it fails to do so.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"In other words, to say that a coin is fair is to say that, theoretically, performing an infinite number of coin flips would result in 50 percent heads and 50 percent tails. However, the Bayesian approach we explored today presents a drastically different picture. In Bayesian statistics, probability is an embodiment of our subjective beliefs about a parameter, such as the fairness of a coin. By performing trials, infinite or not, we gain more information about the parameter of our interest, which affects the posterior probability. Both interpretations of probability are valid, and they help complement each other to help us gain a broader understanding of what the notion of probability entails. I hope this post gave you a better understanding as to why distributions are important—specifically in the context of conjugate priors.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Let’s say we want to estimate the value of an integral of a function  over some domain . Now assume that there is some probability density function  defined over . Then, we can alter this integral as  shown below. Notice that this integral can now be understood as an expected value for some continuous random variable. In other words,  collapses into the following expression. What does this tell us? This means that we can simply calculate an integral by randomly sampling the values of  such that  follows some probability distribution . The probability distribution part simply ensures that values of  that are more probable are sampled more often than others. Intuitively, we are effectively taking a weighted mean of the values of , which is the loose definition of expected values. Now, to simplify things a bit, we are going to take a look at an example that does not involve much probability distributions. Conside the following integal of sine, a classic in calculus 101: The reason why we chose this integral is that we know how to calculate it by hand. Therefore, we can match the accuracy of our crude Monte Carlo against an actual, known value. Let’s fist quickly compute this integral. Now time for Monte Carlo.

BLEU from scratch,"I decided to use anonymous functions for the sake of simplicity and code readability. Next, let’s write a function that creates n-grams from a given sentence. This involves tokenizing the given sentence using , then looping through the tokens to create a bag of words. And here is a quick sanity check of what we’ve done so far. The BLEU score is based on a familar concept in machine learning: precision. Formally, precision is defined as where  and  stand for true and false positives, respectively. In the context of machine translations, we can consider positives as roughly corresponding to the notion of hits or matches. In other words, the positives are the bag of word n-grams we can construct from a given candidate translation. True positives are n-grams that appear in both the candidate and some reference translation; false positives are those that only appear in the candidate translation. Let’s use this intuition to build a simple precision-based metric. First, we need to create some n-grams from the candidate translation. Then, we iterate through the n-grams to see if they exist in any of the n-grams generated from reference translations. We count the total number of such hits, or true positives, and divide that quantity by the total number of n-grams produced from the candidate translation. Below are some candidate sentences and reference translations that we will be using as an example throughout this tutorial.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Visually, we can imagine the neuron being lit up when the value  is large.  This is similar to how the human brain works, except that biological neurons are binary in that they either fires on or off; artifical neurons in a network typically take a range of values. If we expand the vector operation in (5), it becomes quickly obvious that we can represent an entire layer of neurons as a product of two matrices. Our simple neural network model can thus be expressed as follows: The equations above represent our simple neural network model composed of two affine layers. The output of the first affine layer, , is modified by a ReLU unit. Then, the output is passed onto the second affine layer, , the output of which is passed onto a softmax unit. The output of the softmax function is the final output of our model. Note that ReLU and softmax are denoted as max and sigma, respectively. The code below is a function that intializes our network.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"Next, we have to define a prior distribution for the parameter. Let’s say that  is also normally distributed around some mean  with a standard deviation of 1, as shown below.

We already have the first ingredient, the prior, as we have just defined it above. The last piece of the puzzle, then, is the likelihood function. Since we have assumed our data to be independently distributed, we can easily calculate the likelihood as follows: All that is left is to compute the posterior according to Baye’s formula for Bayesian inference. We can thus calculate the MAP estimate of  as shown below. The second equality is due to proportionality, whereby  is independent of  and thus can be removed from the argmax operation. The fourth equality is due to the monotonically increasing nature of the logarithmic function. We always love using logarithms to convert products to sums, because sums are almost always easier to work with than products, especially when it comes to integration or differentiation.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"There is one more tiny little step we have to make to concretize this equation, and that is to consider the average of the total gradient, since (13) as it stands applies to only one data observation.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"As expected, we see that the result is normal, a result due to the property of conjugacy. Another observation we might make is that the posterior mean is seems to be slightly larger than 0. This is an expected result given that the mean of the numbers in our toy data set was larger than 0. Because the posterior can be intuited as an “average” between the observed data set and the prior, we would expect the posterior to be centered around a value greater than zero, which is indeed the case. Now that we have a full answer key to our problem, it’s time to build the Metropolis-Hastings sampler from scratch and compare the estimation generated by the sampler with the true analytical posterior we have just derived. Let’s go back to equation (7), which is the crux of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. To recap, the MCMC sampler works by assuming some value sampled from the proposal distribution, calculating the likelihood and posterior, and seeing if the new proposed value is worth accepting, i.e. if it is worth making a jump in the random walk. All of this sounds pretty abstract when written in words, but it is a simple idea encapsulated by (7). Let’s build the Metropolis-Hastings sampler by implementing the algorithm described above in code as shown below.

Gaussian Process Regression,"The distance function of the squared exponential kernel looks as follows: We can apply distortions to the RBF function by adding things like coefficients, but for simplicity sake we omit them here. The key takeaway is that the RBF kernel function functions as a distance metric between two points. As an extreme example, let’s consider the case when , the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix, which is effectively the variance along those components. Then, Conversely, when  and  are extremely different points, We can thus deduce that the distance function returns a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the similarity or closeness between two points. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want for the covariance matrix. In short, the multivariate Gaussian that we will be using for GP regression can simply be summarized as where covariance  denotes the kernel matrix. In the RBF kernel function above, we were assuming a function without any noise, namely that . However, once we add in Gaussian noise as we saw above with  where , then we need to make adjustments to the kerne to account for added variations. With some thinking, we can persuade ourselves that the only modification that is needed pertains to the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix. This is because  only affects variance that exists within the univariate Gaussian for each point on the -axis without affecting the non-diagonal entries, which otherwise pertain to covariance between two points.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Then, the output of this embedding layer will be flattened to be passed onto a dense layer with one output transformed by the sigmoid activation function. We use the sigmoid function since we want to conduct a sentiment analysis of determining whether a given movie review is positive or negative. That wasn’t so difficult. Let’s initialize our model by defining the model parameters , , and , then plot the model to see the structure of the network alongside the input and output dimensions of each layer. Note that we defined  to be 16, which means that each word is transformed into dense vectors living in 16 dimensions. By plotting the model, we can get a better idea of the layers that compose the model.  The next model we will build is a simple recurrent neural network. This neural network is going to have an embedding layer, just like the previous model. However, instead of a dense layer, it will have two consecutive  layers stacked on top of each other. The  layer is essentially the  implementation of the  model we built earlier. Let’s take a look. We instantiate the model and take plot the network, just as we have done above.  The  model we built is, as the name shamelessly puts out, pretty simple. There are a lot more advanced recurrent neural networks that have complicated internal cell structures to better emulate human memory, in a sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In short, the reason why SVD works is that the eigenvalue matrix  can be obtained either way by performing an eigendecomposition of the matrix  or . Now that we have a mathematical understanding of how singular value decomposition, let’s see how we can apply SVD to build a simple recommendation algorithm. This section will continue as follows. First, we examine SVD as a technique of data compression and dimensionality reduction. Next, we generate some toy data of movie reviews and apply SVD to see how we can build a simple function that gives movie recommendations to users given their movie ratings history. Let’s jump right in. Why is singular value decomposition so important? Sure, it should now be fairly clear that SVD is a decomposition technique that can be applied to any matrix, whether square or not, which in and of itself makes it a very powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. But the true beauty of singular value decomposition comes from the fact that we can perform data compression by extracting meaningful information from the given data. This process is otherwise known as dimensionality reduction, and it is one of the most common applications of singular value decomposition. Let’s see what this means with an example. Here is , a target matrix for singuluar value decomposition. Calculating , we get which is symmetric as we expect.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"All the steps prior to the model would involve wrangling the data; the last step would have the model use the data to make a prediction. Therefore, calling  should apply only to the last model after  is called on all the preprocessing steps. If the pipeline itself is just a bundle of preprocessors, on the other hand, we should only be able to call . Scikit-learn’s models are great, but in a sense they are too great. This is because there are a lot of hypterparameters to tune. Fortunately for us, we can somewhat resort to a quasi-brute force approach to deal with this: train models on a number of different combinations of hyperparameters and find the one that performs best! Well, this is what  does.  is not quite as bad in that it doesn’t create and test all possible models that distinct combinations of hyperparameters can yield: instead, it relies on a randomized algorithm to perform a search of the hyperparameter space. This is why  is a lot quicker than , with marginal sacrifices in model performance. Let’s see how we might be able to perform hyperparameter search given a pipeline like the one we have built above. The parameter space we are searching for here is by no means exhaustive, but it covers a fair amount of ground. Of course, we can go crazy with randomized search, basically shoving Scikit-learn with every possible configuration and even running a grid search instead.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"One way to implement this process is represented below in the  function. Let’s see if the function works properly by passing  as into its argument. Great! As expected,  is a dictionary whose keys represent the class and values contain entries corresponding to that class. Now that we have successfully separated out the data by class, its’ time to write a function that will find the mean and standard deviation of each class data. This process is legitimate only because we assumed the data to be normally distributed—hence the name “Gaussian naive Bayes.” Let’s quickly see this in code. The  function receives a data set as input and returns a nested list that contains the mean and standard deviation of each column of the data set. For example, if we pass the toy data set  into , the returned list will contain two lists: the first list element corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of , and the second list element, . We can combine both  and  functions to create a new wrapper function  that returns the mean and standard deviation of each column for each class. This is a crucial step that will allow us to perform a MAP approximation for the distribution of variables for each class. Testing out the function on  created earlier yields the desired result.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the Bayesian way of thinking was eschewed for so long by statisticians: prior to the advent of calculators and computers, mathematicians had trouble deriving the closed-form expression for the evidence term with just pen and paper. We might consider options other than direct calculation, such as Monte Carlo approximation or deriving a proportionality experssion by assuming evidence to be a constant. Indeed, the latter is the approach we took in this post on Bayesian inference. Using a beta prior and binomial likelihood, we used the property of conjugacy to derive a formula for the posterior. However, this raises yet another question: what if the prior and likelihood do not have a conjugate relationship? What if we have a very messy prior or complicated likelihood function, so convoluted to the point that calculating the posterior is near impossible? Simple Monte Carlo approximation might not do because of a problem called the curse of dimensionality: the volume of the sample space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. In high dimensions, the brute force Monte Carlo approach may not be the most appropriate. Markov Chain Monte Carlo seeks to solve this conundrum of posterior derivation in high dimensions sample space. And indeed, it does a pretty good job of solving it. How does Markov Chain Monte Carlo get around the problem outlined above? To see this, we need to understand the two components that comprise Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Markov chains and Monte Carlo methods.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Gaussian Mixture Models,"We’ve discussed Gaussians a few times on this blog. In particular, recently we explored Gaussian process regression, which is personally a post I really enjoyed writing because I learned so much while studying and writing about it. Today, we will continue our exploration of the Gaussian world with yet another machine learning model that bears the name of Gauss: Gaussian mixture models. After watching yet another inspiring video by mathematicalmonk on YouTube, I meant to write about Gaussian mixture models for quite some time, and finally here it is. I would also like to thank ritvikmath for a great beginner-friendly explanation on GMMs and Expectation Maximization, as well as fiveMinuteStats for a wonderful exposition on the intuition behind the EM algorithm. Without further ado, let’s jump right into it. The motivating idea behind GMMs is that we can model seemingly complicated distributions as a convex combination of Gaussians each defined by different parameters. One visual analogy I found particularly useful is imagining Gaussians as some sort of hill or mountain on a contour map. If we have multiple hills adjacent to one another, we can essentially model the topography of the region as a combination of Gaussians. At peaks, we would see circular contour lines, but where the hills meet, we might see different patterns, most likely circular patterns overlapping with each other. The key point here is that the combination is convex; in other words, the mixing coefficient for each Gaussian should add up to one.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Gaussian Mixture Models,"Therefore, it would be convenient to be able to come up with some expression for the marginal distribution. We can come up with a simple expression using the law of total probability and marginalization. where  can take values between 1 and . Notice that we can thus simplify , as this is simply the categorical distribution for the mixing coefficients. In other words, We can also simplify the condition probability expression, since we already know that it follows a normal distribution. Therefore, we end up with And there we have it, the density function of the Gaussian mixture model! We have a convex combination of  different Gaussian PDFs that compose the Gaussian mixture model. In the context of machine learning, the goal is to find the parameters of the model that best describe some given set of data. In the case of GMMs, this is no different. The parameters that we have to estimate are Of course,  and  are not single vectors or matrices, but  collection of such objects. But for notational simplicity, I opted to write them as such as shown above.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Also, for easier plotting, we will return the  domain range object alongside the result of our simulation. The function is just a two-liner—we were able to reduce the number of lines thanks to list comprehension. Now, let’s see if this code works as expected. Here, our experiment consisted of sampling two numbers, starting from range , all the way up to range , with 1000 simulations for each range. Let’s plot the results to get a better idea of what was going on.  First, notice that when , the probability that two sampled numbers are coprime is 1. This is unsurprising, since sampling from range  simply means that both the sampled numbers were 2—and of course, 2 and 2 are coprimes. However, as the range expands all the way up to 200, we see that the probability of two numbers being coprime drops precipitously, roughly converging to the value of  as we expect. Indeed, the dots seem to cluster around the gold line, which represents the value of the Zeta function evaluated at 2. But does this result generalize to cases where we sample more than just two numbers? In other words, if we sample  numbers, would the probability that the numbers be coprime approach ? Let’s find out. Given a range of  values, the  function returns a plot for each , which is effectively  in our mathematical notation. We see that, for the three values of  that were tested—2, 3, and 4—the Zeta function seems to approximate the probability of relative primeness pretty well.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fisher Score and Information,"Therefore, given some dataset, often times we use the empirical Fisher as a drop-in substitute for Fisher’s information. The empirical Fisher is defined quite simply as follows: In other words, it is simply an unweighted average of the covariance of the score function for each observed data point. Although this is a subtlety, it helps to clarify nonetheless. Something that may not be immediately apparent yet nonetheless true and very important about Fisher’s information is the fact that it is the negative expected value of the second derivative of the log likelihood. In our multivariate context where  is a vector, the second derivative is effectively the Hessian. In other words, You might be wondering how the information matrix can be defined in two says, the covariance and the Hessian. Indeed, this threw me off quite a bit as well, and I struggled to find and understand a good resource that explained why this was the case. Thankfully, Mark Reid’s blog and an MIT lecture contained some very helpful pointers that got me a long way. The derivation is not the easiest, but I’ll try to provide a concise version based on my admittedly limited understanding of this topic. Let’s start from some trivially obvious statements. First, from the definition of a PDF and the derivative operation, we know that Therefore, both the first and second derivative of this function are going to be zero.

Word2vec from Scratch,"For backpropagation, we will need all the intermediate variables, so we hold them in a dictionary called . However, if we simply want the final prediction vectors only, not the cache, we set  to . This is just a little auxiliary feature to make things slightly easier later. We also have to implement the  function we used above. Note that this function receives a matrix as input, not a vector, so we will need to slightly tune things up a bit using a simple loop. At this point, we are done with implementing the forward pass. However, before we move on, it’s always a good idea to check the dimensionality of the matrices, as this will provide us with some useful intuition while coding backward propagation later on. The dimensionality of the matrix after passing the first layer, or the embedding layer, is as follows: This is expected, since we want all the 330 tokens in the text to be converted into ten-dimensional vectors. Next, let’s check the dimensionality after passing through the second layer. This time, it is a 330-by-60 matrix. This also makes sense, since we want the output to be sixty dimensional, back to the original dimensions following one-hot encoding. This result can then be passed onto the softmax layer, the result of which will be a bunch probability vectors.

"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","Moreover, the integral term can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function since Applying all the simplifications leave us with Notice that this is a recursive representation of the factorial, since we can further unravel  using the same definition. In other words, So it is now clear that the Gamma function is indeed an interpolation of the factorial function. But the Gamma function deserves a bit more attention and analysis than the simple evaluation we have performed above. Specifically, I want to introduce a few more alternative forms of expressing and deriving the Gamma function. There are many ways to approach this subject, and it would be impossible to exhaust through the entire list of possible representations. For the purposes of this post, we look at two forms of the Gamma function I find intriguing. The first version, presented below, is Euler’s definition of the Gamma function as an infinite product. To see how this comes from, we backtrack this equality by dividing the right-hand side by . At this point, we can reduce the fraction by eliminating  from both the denominator and the numerator, which leaves us with the following expression: Therefore, we have This is another representation of the Gamma function that is distinct from the integral we saw earlier.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"We will revisit this problem in a separate post. Another reason why the Beta distribution is an excellent choice for our prior representation is that it is a conjugate prior to the binomial distribution. Simply put, this means that using the Beta distribution as our prior, combined with a binomial likelihood function, will produce a posterior  that also follows a Beta distribution. This fact is crucial for Bayesian analysis. Recall that the beauty of Bayesian inference originates from repeated applicability: a posterior we obtain after a single round of calculation can be used as a prior to perform the next iteration of inference. In order to ensure the ease of this procedure, intuitively it is necessary for the prior and the posterior to take the same form of distribution. Conjugate priors streamline the Bayesian process of updating our priors with posteriors by ensuring that this condition is satisfied. In simple language, mathematicians have found that certain priors go well with certain likelihoods. For instance, a normal prior goes along with a normal likelihood; Gamma prior, Poisson likelihood; Gamma prior, normal likelihood, and so on. Our current combination, Beta prior and binomial likelihood, is also up on this list. To develop some intuition, here is a graphical representation of the Beta function for different values of  and . This code block produces the following diagram. Graphically speaking, the larger the value of  and , the more bell-shaped it becomes.

Introduction to seq2seq models,"Now that we have a seq2seq model, let’s write some code for the training loop.

We see that this is quite a big model, with a total of 13898757 trainable parameters. Let’s define the optimizer and criterion for training. Since the model basically outputs logits for a distribution, we can consider it to be a classification problem. Hence we use cross entropy loss, with the minor caveat that we ignore the padding index. For each batch, we obtain the prediction output of the model. There are several details to take care of when calculating the loss. Namely, we need to cut off the first time step of the target and predicted outputs. This is because the output and predictions will look as follows, assuming no extraneous padding: If you examine the  model we designed earlier, you will see that  starts from 1, meaning that the  tensor’s zeroth index will be left untouched as zeros; hence the 0 in . Therefore, we need to slice the tensors and start from the first index. Moreover, we shape the tensors to be two-dimensional since cross entropy expects the predictions to be two-dimensional; the labels, one-dimensional. Last but not least, we clip the gradients to prevent exploding gradients. Next, we evaluate the model.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"You might remember back in the old days when autocomplete was just terrible. The suggestions provided by autocomplete would be useless if not downright stupid—I remember that one day when I intended to type “Gimme a sec,” only to see my message get edited into “Gimme a sex” by the divine touches of autocomplete. On the same day, the feature was turned off on my phone for the betterment of the world. Now, times have changed. Recently, I decided to give autocorrect a chance on my iPhone. Surprisingly, I find myself liking autocomplete more than hating it, especially now that the weather is getting colder by each day: when my frost-numbed finger tips touch on the wrong places of the phone screen to produce words that aren’t really words, iPhone’s autocomplete somehow magically reads my mind to rearrange all that inscrutable alphabet soup into words that make actual, coherent sense. Sometimes, it’s so good at correcting my typos that I intentionnally make careless mistakes on the keyboard just to see how far it can go. One of the obvious reasons behind such drastic improvements in autocomplete functionality is the development of deep neural networks. As we know, neural networks are great at learning hidden patterns as long as we feed it with enough data.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"If we can plot  onto the space above, we will be able to see to whom User 10’s preference is most similar.

The plot is shown below:  With some alteration of the viewing angle, now we see through visualization that Movies 2 and 3 are close, as we had expected from the original ratings matrix . This is an interesting result, and it shows just how powerful singular value decomposition is at extracting important patterns from given data sets. Now that we understand what SVD does for us, it’s time to code our recommender function that uses distance calculation to output movie recommendations. In this post, we will be using the dot product as a means of determining distance, although other metrics such as Euclidean distance would suit our purposes as well. An advantage of using the dot product is that it is computationally less expensive and easy to achieve with code, as shown below. The  function recommends an  number of movies given that the user rated  highly. For example, let’s say some user really liked Movie 2 and is looking for two more movies that are similar to Movie 2.

Neural Style Transfer,"There is no “NMT model” that transforms some image; rather, we merely calculate a loss that is the combination of the content loss and style loss, then optimize the image with respect to this combined loss.

Intuitively, the more stylized an image, the higher the content loss; the smaller the content loss, the higher the style loss. In a way, these two quantities are somewhat mutually exclusive, which is why we want to use a weight constant to ascribe some level of importance to one over the other. Some variations to this formula include those that include weights for both the style and content terms, such as At the end of the day, both formulations are identical, only scaled by some scalar value. (2) is a special case of (1) where . Thus, we can always go from (1) to (2) simply by multiplying by some constant. For simplicity reasons, we will assume (1) throughout this tutorial.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"This is why we use bytes to represent the amount of disk storage in computers, for instance. It is also worth mentioning that the alternative name for bits is Shannons, named eponymously after the mathematician who pioneered the field of information theory, as mentioned above. Now that we have some idea of what information is and how we can quantify it using binary numbers in bits, it’s time to get into the math. Information can be calculated through the formula where  is the information need to express the random event , and  is the probability that event  occurs, i.e. . There are different versions of this formula, such as the one that uses Euler’s constant as the log base instead of 2. Whereas the unit of information as measured through (1) is in bits, that calculated through (2) as shown below is in the unit of nats. For the purposes of this post, we will be using equation (1) instead of two. This is primarily because we will be using the binary number analogy to build an intuition for information computation. Let’s quickly create a visualization that shows the relationship between probability and information in bits.

Dissecting LSTMs,"The first component of LSTM is the forget gate. This corresponds to these two set of equations: (1) is nothing more than just the good old forward pass. We concatenate  and , then multiply it with some weights, add a bias, and apply a sigmoid activation. At this point, you might be wondering why we use a sigmoid activation instead of something like ReLU. The reason behind this choice of activation function becomes apparent once we look at (4), which is how LSTM imitates forgetting. For now, we will only focus on the first term in (4). Recall that the output of a sigmoid activation is between 0 and 1. Say the output of applying a sigmoid activation results in some value that is very close to 0. In that case, calculating the Hadamard product will also result in a value of an entry very close to 0. Given the interpretation that , also known as the cell state, is an artificial way of simulating long-term memory, we can see how having zeros is similar to forgetfulness: a zero entry effectively means that the network deemed a particular piece of information as obsolete and decided to forget it in favor of accepting new information. In short, the sigmoid activation and the Hadamard product form the basis of LSTM’s forget gate. By now, it should be apparent why we use sigmoid activations: instead of causing divergence with something like ReLU, we want to deliberately saturate and cause the network to produce some “vanishing” values.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Fourier Series,"For example, The same applies to cosines and sines: where  and  can be any integer.

It’s time to sit back and let the magic unfold when we multiply  to (1) and integrate the entire expression. If we divide both sides of (5) by , you will realize that we have derived an expression for the constant corresponding to the  expansion term: The key takeaway here is this: by exploiting orthogonality, we can knock out every term but one, the very term that we multiplied to the expansion. By the same token, therefore, we can  deduce that we can do the same for the sine terms: The only small caveat is that the case is a bit more specific for . When ,  reduces to a constant of one, which is why we end up with  instead of .

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"This code block produces the following output: The first entry of this array, which is the value , deserves our attention, as it is the eigenvalue which corresponds to the stationary distribution eigenvector. Since the index of this value is , we can identify its eigenvector as follows: Notice that this eigenvector is a representation of a situation in which the player is in the th cell of the game board! In other words, it is telling us that once the user reaches the th cell, they will stay on that cell even after more dice rolls—hence the stationary distribution. On one hand, this information is impractical given that a player who reaches the end goal will not continue the game to go beyond the th cell. On the other hand, it is interesting to see that the eigenvector reveals information about the structure of the Markov chain in this example. Markov chains like these are referred to as absorbing Markov chains because the stationary equilibrium always involves a non-escapable state that “absorbs” all other states. One might visualize this system as having a loop on a network graph, where it is impossible to move onto a different state because of the circular nature of the edge on the node of the absorbing state.

One useful observation to make here is the fact that the numerator itself looks a lot like something we have seen before: the Beta distribution. In fact, you might also realize that the denominator is nothing but just a normalizing constant that ensures that our posterior distribution, when integrated from 0 to 1, integrates up to 1 as the axiom of probability states. We can also see the denominator as the definition of the Beta function. In other words, Therefore, we end up with Notice that offers an extremely nice interpretation: the number of success  and failures , which are determined by , yield insight into what the true parameter is via the Beta distribution. This is why the Beta distribution is often referred to as a “probability distribution of probabilities.” I highly recommend that you read this post on cross validated for many intuitive explanations of what the Beta distribution is and how it can be useful, such as in this Bayesian context. Now we know that there is a closed-form solution for Bayesian problems involving conjugate priors and likelihood functions, such as a Beta prior coupled with the binomial likelihood.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"This is why deep learning is such a powerful tool: it can be trained to detect nonlinear, complex patterns in data that a human might otherwise be unable to identify. Our vanilla neural network will make use of two activation functions: softmax and ReLU. If you have read my previous post on the Keras functional API, you might recall that we used softmax and ReLU for certain dense layers. Back then, we considered them to be a blackbox without necessarily taking a look at what they do. Let’s explore the details and get our hands dirty today. Mathematically speaking, the softmax function is a function that takes a vector as input and outputs a vector of equal length. Concretely, where Although the formula may appear complex, the softmax function is a lot simpler than it seems. First, note that all  entries of the returned vector  add up to 1. From here, it is possible to see that the softmax function is useful for ascribing the probability that a sample belongs to one of  classes: the -th element of  would indicate the probability of the sample belonging to the -th class. Put another way, the index of the largest entry in  is the class label number that is most probable.

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"For easier training and learning, I decided to use  to initialize these hidden states. We can now build our model and start training it.

We could look at other metrics, but accuracy is by far the simplest, so let’s go with that. The model records a 72 percent accuracy rate. This is very bad, but given how simple the models is and the fact that we only trained the model for two epochs, we can lay back and indulge in momentary happiness knowing that the simple RNN model was at least able to learn something. Let’s see how well our model does with some concrete examples. Below is a function that accepts a string as input and outputs a decoded prediction. I don’t know if any of these names were actually in the training or testing set; these are just some random names I came up with that I thought would be pretty reasonable. And voila, the results are promising. The model seems to have classified all the names into correct categories! This is cool and all, and I could probably stop here, but I wanted to see how this custom model fares in comparison to, say, a model using PyTorch layers.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
Bayesian Linear Regression,"In today’s post, we will take a look at Bayesian linear regression. Both Bayes and linear regression should be familiar names, as we have dealt with these two topics on this blog before. The Bayesian linear regression method is a type of linear regression approach that borrows heavily from Bayesian principles. The biggest difference between what we might call the vanilla linear regression method and the Bayesian approach is that the latter provides a probability distribution instead of a point estimate. In other words, it allows us to reflect uncertainty in our estimate, which is an additional dimension of information that can be useful in many situations. By now, hopefully you are fully convinced that Bayesian linear regression is worthy of our intellectual exploration. Let’s take a deep dive into Bayesian linear regression, then see how it works out in code using the  library. In this section, we will derive the formula for Bayesian linear regression step-by-step. If you are feeling rusty on linear algebra or Bayesian analysis, I recommend that you go take a quick review of these concepts before proceeding. Note that I borrowed heavily from this video for reference. For any regression problem, we first need a data set. Let  denote this pre-provided data set, containing  entries where each entry contains an -dimensional vector and a corresponding scalar. Concretely, where The goal of Bayesian linear regression is to find the predictive posterior distribution for .

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"From a statistics point of view, all we have to do now is conduct a random survey of the population to see the percentage of the demographic infected with the flu. Let’s say that 15 percent of the population has been affected with this flu. Plugging in the relevant value yields Using Bayes’ theorem, we are able to conclude that there is roughly a 24 percent chance that the man who tests positive on this examination is affected by the flu. That seems pretty low given the 90 percent accuracy of the test, doesn’t it? This ostensible discrepancy originates from the fact that the test has a substantial false positive of 50 percent, and also that the vast majority of the population is unaffected by the disease. This means that, if the entire population were to conduct this test, there would be more false positives than there would be true positives; hence the distortion in the value of the conditional probability. But what if the man were to take the same test again? Intuition tells us that the more test he takes, the more confident we can be on whether the man is or is not affected by the disease. For instance, if the man repeats the exam once and receives a positive report, the conditional probability that he is sick given two consecutive positive test results should be higher than the 24 percent we calculated above.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This constraint immediately tells us that where  is represents the probability density function that represents the prior. Recall that some of the other functions we have looked at, namely binomial, Poisson, Gamma, or exponential are all defined within the unclosed interval , making it unsuitable for our purposes. The Beta distribution nicely satisfies this criterion. The Beta distribution is somewhat similar to the Gamma distribution we analyzed earlier in that it is defined by two shape parameters,  and . Concretely, the probability density function of the Beta distribution goes as follows: The coefficient, expressed in terms of a fraction of Gamma functions, provides a definition for the Beta function. The derivation of the Beta distribution and its apparent relationship with the Gamma function deserves an entirely separate post devoted specifically to the said topic. For the purpose of this post, an intuitive understanding of this distribution and function will suffice. A salient feature of the Beta distribution that is domain is contained within . This means that, application-wise, the Beta distribution is most often used to model a distribution of probabilities, say the batting average of a baseball player as shown in this post. It is also worth noting that the Beta function, which serves as a coefficient in the equation for the Beta PDF, serves as a normalization constant to ensure that integrating the function over the domain  would yield 1 as per the definition of a PDF.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"It’s finally time to test the model. Let’s first begin with data preparation and preprocessing. Now, we should have the training and test set ready to be fed into our network. Next, let’s define a simple callback application using the  monitor so that training can be stopped when no substantial improvements are being made to our model. This was included because training a VAE can take some time, and we don’t want to waste computing resources seeing only submarginal increments to the model performance. Training begins! After 14 epochs, training has stopped, meaning that no meaningful improvements were being made. Let’s visualize the representation of the latent space learned by the VAE. Visualizing this representation is easy in this case because we defined the latent space to be two-dimensional; in other words, all points can be plotted on a Cartesian plane. Let’s take a look:  This plot shows us how each numbers are distributed across the latent space. Notice that numbers that belong to the same class seem to be generally clustered around each other, although there is a messy region in the middle. This is a reasonable result: while we would expect ones to be fairly easy to distinguish from, say, eights, numbers like zeros and sixes might look very similar, and hence appear mixed as a lump in the fuzzy region in the middle. One cool thing about VAEs is that we can use their learned representation to see how numbers slowly morph and vary across a specified domain.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
InceptionNet in PyTorch,"Specifically, we throw the model three options: one-by-one, three-by-three, and five-by-five kernels, and we let the model figure out how to weigh and process information from these kernels. In the  below, you will see that there are indeed various branches, and that the output from these branches are concatenated to produce a final output in the  function. Researchers who conceived the InceptionNet architecture decided to add auxiliary classifiers to intermediary layers of the model to ensure that the model actually learns something useful. This was included in InceptionV1; as far as I’m aware, future versions of InceptionNet do not include auxiliary classifiers. Nonetheless, I’ve added it here, just for the fun of it. Now we finally have all the ingredients needed to flesh out the entire model. This is going to a huge model, but the code isn’t too long because we’ve abstracted out many of the building blocks of the model as  or . I won’t get into the details here, as the number of parameters are simply from the original paper. As you can see, there are auxiliary classifiers here and there.

This representation, in particular, could be understood as an integral over a unit square in the cartesian coordinate over a bivariate function, . In this post, we took a look at a new way of approaching the Basel problem using Fourier expansion. We also looked at some interesting integral representations of the Basel problem. While a lot of this is just simple calculus and algebra, I nonetheless find it fascinating how the Basel problem can be approached from so many different angles—hence my renewed respect for Euler and other mathematicians who wrestled with this problem hundreds of years ago. As simple as it appears, there are so many different techniques and modes of analysis we can use to approach the problem. It was nice exercise and review of some calculus techniques. I’ve been digging more into the curious interchange of integral and summation recently, and when this operation is allowed, if at all. Turns out that this problem is slightly more complicated than it appears and requires some understanding of measure theory, which I had tried getting into a few months ago without much fruition.

Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Let’s top this discussion off with a look at the confusion matrix, which is another way of compactly encoding various pieces of information for model evaluation, namely true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Note that precision and recall are all metrics that are computed using TP, TN, FP and FN as parameters. The confusion matrix shows that our model performs well at determining the death and survival of those passengers who actually died, but performs rather poorly on those who lived. Analyses like these cannot be obtained simply by looking at accuracy, which is why plotting the confusion matrix is always a good idea to get a sense of the model’s performance.  Although the titanic dataset is considered trite, much like MNIST is in the context of DL, I still think there is a lot to be learned. Even simple ML projects like these have infinite spaces and options for exploration and experimentation. I hope to go through these classic datasets and competitions to glean insight from excellent public kernels, just like this Kaggle kernel which I referenced extensively to write this tutorial. In its inception, this post was conceived of as a simple introduction to ’s pipelines, but it eventually ballooned up into a somewhat comprehensive rundown of a little Kaggle project.

There are many concepts and theories surrounding the Gamma function, such as the Euler-Mascheroni constant, Mellin transformation, and countless many more, but these might be tabled for another discussion as they each deserve a separate post.

It is from here that we went down the rabbit hole of Google and Wikipedia search. I ended up landing on entropy land, which is going to be the topic for today’s post. It’s a random post on the topic of randomness.

"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","Euler begins his exposition by analyzing the Taylor expansion of the sine function, which goes as follows: Dividing both sides by , we obtain the following: Now it’s time to follow Euler’s amazing intuition.

This is expected given the periodic behavior of the sine function and its intercepts with the -axis. Given these zeros, we can then reconstruct the original function  as an infinite product using the fundamental theorem of algebra, or more specifically, Weierstrass factorization. Let’s try to factor out the coefficient of the  term through some elementary induction. First, we observe that calculating the product of the first two terms produces the following expression: Then, we can express the target coefficient, denoted by , as follows: Where  denotes the coefficient of  obtained by expanding the rest of the terms following  in the infinite product above. If we repeat this process once more, a clear pattern emerges: Iterating over this process will eventually allow us to express our target coefficient as a sum of inverse squares multiplied by some constant, in this case : But then we already know the value of  from the modification of the Taylor polynomial for sine we saw earlier, which is !

There is a  that I could have easily used, and indeed there is an entire discussion on the PyTorch forum on the difference between the two. The bottom line is that they are pretty similar for our purposes. The most salient difference between the two is that the functional approach cannot be used when declaring a sequential model. However, since we are defining a custom forward function, this limitation does not apply. Personally, I prefer the functional because it means that there is one less layer to declare in the initialization function. However, it’s probably better to err on the side of the  if you’re not totally sure. Now that we’ve designed and implemented a model, it’s time to train it.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"Now what’s next? Since we have a loss function, we need to build an algorithm that will allow us to minimize this cost function. One of the most common methods used to achieve cost minimization is gradient descent. As you might be able to tell, this algorithm has a lot to do with gradients, which can loosely be understood as a fancy way of saying derivatives. Below is an illustration of the gradient descent algorithm in action, sourced from this blog.  Basically, what gradient descent does is that it takes the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight vector every epoch, or iteration, and takes a small step in the opposite direction of that derivative. If you think of this in the context of two dimensions as shown in the illustration, the gradient descent algorithm ends up moving down the parabola, taking little steps each time, until it eventually reaches the global minimum. In mathematical notation, we might express this process as follows: If we were to perform this in vectorized format, where  represents a vector containing the weight coefficients of the logistic regression model: The  notation is used to denote gradients, an important operation in matrix calculus which we explored in when deriving the normal equation solution to linear regression on this blog.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"However, we can get a bit more scientific by calculating the cross entropy to see exactly how well our model performed with the given data. To achieve this, let’s quickly write some functions to calculate KL divergence and cross entropy. We will be reusing the  function we defined above. On a trivial note, we prevent Python from running into math domain errors, we add  to the provided distribution if the list contains 0. The result is unsurprising. If we recall that the definition of entropy is the amount of information content needed to encode information, we will quickly realize that  is a distribution with probability 1, which is why it makes sense that entropy converges to 0. Therefore, in this case, KL divergence equals cross entropy, which computes to approximately 0.415. What actually happened beneath the hood? If we recall the definition of cross entropy, we can easily see that, among the 10 terms, 9 of them were eliminated since  given the setup of the distribution . In the end, the only term that mattered was the third term, which was given by Why does this quantity make sense as an error term defining a loss function?

Better seq2seq,"In the code block below, we load the  dataset, then create bucket iterators for each train, validation, and test split. Let’s start with the encoder. The encoder here is actually almost identical to the one we implemented in the previous model. In fact, it is arguably simpler, as we are now using a single GRU layer instead of a two-layered LSTM. The decoder is where all the enhancements are going to take place. Recall the changes we want to make to the previous seq2seq architecture.  As you can see, we need to make sure that The first change means that the decoder’s forward method needs to be able to take in the encoder’s hidden states as input. For sake of notational clarity, let’s call those hidden states as “context.” The way we allow the decoder to use its own hidden state as well as the context for computation is that we concatenate the context with its input embeddings. Effectively, we could think of this as creating a new embedding vectors, where the first half comes from actual embeddings of English tokens and the later half comes from the context vector. Another implementation detail not mentioned earlier is the dimension of the last fully connected classifier layer. Since we now concatenate the embedding vector with the hidden state from the GRU, context vector from the encoding, as well as the original embedding vectors, the classifier’s input dimensions are much larger than they were in the previous decoder model.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Like this, conditional probability allows us to update our beliefs on uncertainty given new information, and we will see in the later sections that this is the core idea behind Bayesian inference.

We cannot assume that the man is sick, however, since the test has a rather high rate of false positives as we saw earlier.

Also keep in mind that since  is a recurrent variable, we have to apply the gradient from the next call as well, just like . Note that all we had to do is to multiply the  function we derived above, then add the backpropgation from the next iteration to account for the recurrent nature of the network. We still have a decent amount of work to do, but the fortunate news is that once we derive an expression for one parameter, the rest can also be obtained in an identical fashion.

With this generalized equation in hand, we can plug in  into  to see Euler’s identity: The classic proof, although fairly straightforward, is not my favorite mode of proving Euler’s identity because it does not reveal any properties about the exponentiation of an imaginary number, or an irrational number for that matter. Instead, I found geometric interpretations of Euler’s formula to be more intuitive and thought-provoking. Below is a version of a proof for Euler’s identity. Let’s start by considering the complex plane. There are two ways of expressing complex numbers on the Argand diagram: points and vectors.

Recall that the formula for the exponential distribution is where the indicator function, denoted as , takes the following form: The indicator function is a simple  modification applied to ensure that the function is well-defined across the entire real number domain. Normally, we omit the indicator function since it is self-apparent, but for the sake of robustness in our analysis, I have added it here. How can we coerce equation (6) to look more like (3), the archetypal form that defines the exponential family? Well, now it’s just a matter of drag and match: by paying close attention to the variables, parameters, and the output of each function, we can reconstruct (3) to take the form of (6). The easeist starting point is to observe the exponent to identify  and , after which the rest of the surrounding functions can be inferred.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"Nonetheless, we can approximate the distribution of this random variable by considering each ten-minute blocks as a unit for a single trial, i.e. if a call is received by the PMO between 22:00 and 22:10, then the trial is a success; if not, a failure.

Given that my military service will last only 1.5 years from now, I won’t every have such a lucky day again, at least according to the binomial distribution.

How might we be able to express information involved in the event that the coin lands on tails? How about heads?

Of course, there might be other ways to encode information, such as setting 111 to heads and 000 to tails, but obviously this is wasting information. In other words, it is not the most efficient method of encoding. Even under a single digit binary number scheme, we would be able to decode a series of transmitted information without loss. It is not difficult to see, therefore, that all we need to express the result of a fair coin toss is a single digit of binary numbers 0 and 1. Typically, we use bits to denote the number of digits required to express information in binary numbers. In this case, the information involved in  is equal to 1 bit; by symmetry, the same goes for .

I’ll simply be using  to display a bivariate Gaussian. For reproducibility’s sake, we will also set a random seed. The code for the Gibbs sampler is simple, partially because the distribution we are dealing with is a bivariate Gaussian, not some high-dimensional intractable distribution. This point notwithstanding, the  function shows the gist of how Gibbs sampling works. Here, we pass in parameters for the conditional distribution, and start sampling given an initial  value corresponding to . As stated earlier, this random value can be chosen arbitrarily. Of course, if we start from a value that is way off, it will take much longer for the algorithm to converge, i.e. we will have to discard a large portion of initially sampled values. This is known as burn-in. In this case, however, we will apply a quick hack and start from a plausible value to begin with, reducing the need for burn-in.

Also note that we get 4 vectors of length 9 each, as expected. Next, it’s time to implement the idf portion of the vectorization process. In order to calculate idf, we first need a total count of each number in the entire document collection. A module that is perfect for this job is , which accepts as input an iterable and outputs a dictionary-like object whose values represent the count of each key. Let’s test in on our dummy dataset to see if we get the count of each tokenized word. This is precisely what we need to calculate idf. Recall the formula for calculating idf As noted earlier, the intuition behind idf was that important keywords probably appear only in specific relevant documents, whereas generic words of comparatively lesser importance appear throughout all documents. We transcribe (4) into code as follows: Now, we have the idf vectors for the nine terms in the dummy dataset.

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Last but not least, let’s visualize the training scheme of all four models to take a identify any possible signs of convergence and overfitting, if any. To do that, we will be using the  function shown below. The dense feed-forward network seems to have a very linear pattern. One immediate pattern we see is that the model seems to be overfitting right away, since the testing accuracy decreases with each epoch while the training accuracy increases. This is certainly not a good sign; in the best case scenario, we want to see that training and testing labels moving in the same direction. Perhaps this is the biggest indication that a simple feed forward network is a suboptimal model choice in the context of this problem.  The graphs for the  model seems a lot better. At the very least, we see the training and test labels moving in unison: the accuracy increases with each epoch, while the loss slowly decreases. However, we do see some overfitting happening at the last two epochs or so. Specifically, note that cross entropy loss for the testing data seems to pick up an incrementing pattern past the seventh epoch. This observation suggests that we need to configure the model differently, presumably by decreasing the number of tunable parameters.  Next comes the winner of the day, the LSTM network.

Well, an intuitive pitfall we might expect is that the model might end up generating a repetition of some likely sequence of characters. For example, let’s say the model’s estimated distribution deems the sequence “God is dead” to be likely. Then, the output of our model might end up being something like this: …(some input text) God is dead God is dead God is dead… (repetition elided) We don’t want this to happen. Instead, we want to introduce some noise so that the model faces subtle obstructions, thereby making it get more “creative” with its output instead of getting trapped in an infinite loop of some likely sequence. Below is a sample implementation of adding noise to the output using log and exponential transformations to the output vector of our model. The transformation might be expressed as follows: where   denotes a transformation,  denotes a prediction as a vector,  denotes temperature as a measure of randomness, and  is a normalizing constant. Although this might appear complicated, all it’s doing is that it is adding some perturbation or disturbance to the output data so that it is possible for less likely characters to be chosen as the final prediction. Below is a sample implementation of this process in code. Note that due to the algebraic quality of the vector transformation above, randomness is increased for large values of .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The objective of Bayesian statistical analysis is to update our beliefs about some probability, known as the posterior, given a preestablished belief, called the prior, and a series of data observations, which might be decomposed into likelihood and evidence. Concretely, This statement is equivalent to where  denotes the likelihood function. In plain language, Bayesian statistics operates on the assumption that all probabilities are reflections of subjective beliefs about the distribution of some random variable. A prior expectation or belief we might have about this distribution is referred to as the prior. Then, we can update our prior belief based on sample observations, resulting in a posterior distribution. Roughly speaking, the posterior can be considered as the “average” between the prior and the observed data. This process, which we went over in detail in this post, is at the heart of Bayesian inference, a powerful tool through which data and distributions can be understood. Theoretically, everything should work fine: given some prior and some sample observation data, we should be able to derive a posterior distribution for the random variable of interest. No big deal. Or so it seems. If we take a look again at equation (3), we will realize that there is an evidence term that we have to calculate sitting in the denominator. The formula for evidence can be expressed as follows: Computing this quantity is not as easy as it may appear.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"The other day, I came across an interesting article by Chris Henson on the relationship between the Riemann Zeta function and prime numbers. After encountering a similar post on the math Stack Exchange, I thought I’d write an article on the same topic as well, perhaps as sort of a prologue to a previous article posted on this blog, Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler. The code introduced in this blog are adaptations of those written by Chris Henson, so all credits go to the original author. With that said, let’s dive right into it. The Riemann Zeta function is perhaps one of the most deeply studied functions in all of modern mathematics. It is sometimes also referred to as the Euler-Riemann Zeta function, but I will not adhere to this convention not only because it is needlessly long and cumbersome, but also because Euler already has so many constants and functions and theorems bearing his name. Anyhow, the Riemann Zeta function looks as follows: While there are so many layers to explore with this function, one relatively simple and interesting route is to factorize this function. We performed this factorization in the previous post while introducing Euler’s infinite product representation of the Zeta function. Let’s go through this step again, as it is pivotal for our segue into the topic of prime numbers and probability.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"Because the multiplying any arbitrary vector by the identity matrix returns the vector itself, all vectors in the dimensional space can be considered an eigenvector to the matrix , with  = 1. A formal way to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be derived from the equation above. Since  is assumed as a nonzero vector, we can deduce that the matrix  is a singular matrix with a nontrivial null space. In fact, the vectors in this null space are precisely the eigenvectors that we are looking for. Here, it is useful to recall that the a way to determine the singularity of a matrix is by calculating its determinant. Using these set of observations, we can modify the equation above to the following form: By calculating the determinant of , we can derive the characteristic polynomial, from which we can obtain the set of eigenvectors for  representing some linear transformation . Now that we have reviewed some underlying concepts, perhaps it is time to apply our knowledge to a concrete example. Before we move on, I recommend that you check out this post I have written on the Markov process, just so that you are comfortable with the material to be presented in this section.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","And here is the result! An overall accuracy of 70 percent is definitely not impressive, and we certainly could have done better by building a deeper model, or by using more complex architectures.

The more important takeaway from this tutorial is how to prepare data, build models, and train and evaluate them through a custom loop. From the tone and style of my writing, it is perhaps immediately clear to you that I am not officially a PyTorch fanboy.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"The returned result is not abysmal, but we clearly can do a lot better. The reason behind this spotty estimation can be checked by drawing the plot of the Monte Carlo simulation, as shown below.  As we can see, ten samples simply aren’t enough to really cover the entire area of the plane or the circle. Although we do get some points in the circle, it’s really hard to tell if the proportion of points in and out of the circle is going to be representative of the actual proportion of area between the circle and the square. Let’s push our MC algorithm to do a bit more by sampling more data points, this time with 100000 randomly generated points. As expected, with more data points, we get a better estimation of pi. Although the randomness created by the  call in our function means that this estimation will fluctuate with each execution, the value is reliably close to the actual value of , differing only by about 0.01 or less. If we draw the plot for our experiment, it is clear that our data points accurately capture the proportionality between the area of the square and the circle.  We can systematically verify that more samples tend to yield better results by graphing the magnitude of the error of our estimation plotted against the number of random samples generated.  The plot shows that, with larger sample sizes, the error quickly converges to around 0.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
The Gibbs Sampler,"So at this point, we have now empirically checked that Gibbs sampling indeed works: even if we can’t directly sample from the distribution, if we have access to conditional distributions, we can still achieve an asymptotically similar result. Now comes the mathematics portion of deriving the conditional distribution of a multivariate Gaussian, as promised earlier. In this section, we will derive an expression for the conditional distribution of the multivariate Gaussian. This isn’t really relevant to the Gibbs sampling algorithm itself, since the sampler can be used in non-Gaussian contexts as long as we have access to conditional distributions. Nonetheless, deriving this is a good mental exercise that merits some discussion. Just for the sake of quick review, let’s briefly revisit the familiar definition of a conditional probability: In the context of random vectors, we can rewrite this as Of course, if  and  are scalars, we go back to the familiar bivariate context of our example. In short, deriving the expression for the conditional distribution simply amounts to simplifying the fraction whose denominator is the marginal distribution and the numerator is the joint distribution. Let’s clarify the setup and notation first. We define a -dimensional random vector that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, namely . This vector, denoted as , can be split into a -dimensional vector  and -dimensional vector  in the following fashion: It is apparent that .

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","is a super class from which we can inherit to build anything from full-fledged models to custom blocks or layers to be used in some other larger model. In the initialization function, we also define a number of layers that will be used in forward propagation. You might be wondering why these have to initialized in the initialization function, as opposed to the forward function itself. While I don’t have a complete, technically cogent explanation to that question, intuitively, we can understand a model’s layers as being components of the model itself. After all, the weights of these layers are adjusted with each iteration or epoch. In that sense, we want the layers to be attached to the model instance itself; hence the OOP design of PyTorch’s model class. In this particular instance, we define a number of convolutional layers, a pooling layer, and two fully connected layers used for classification output. The declaration of the layers themselves are not too different from other frameworks, such as TensorFlow. Also, I’ve written out all the named arguments so that it is immediately clear what each argument is configuring. Once we’ve declared all the necessary components in the initialization function, the next steps to actually churn out forward propagation results given some input.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"In the context of probability, Jensen’s inequality can be summarized as follows. Given a convex function , We won’t get into rigorous proofs here, but it’s not difficult to see why this inequality stands with some basic geometric intuition. Due to its bow-like shape, the expected value of a convex function evaluated across a given interval will always be greater or equal to the function evaluated at the expected value of the random variable.  How is Jensen’s inequality related to the non-negativity of KL divergence? Let’s return back to the definition of KL divergence. For simplicity and to reduce notational burden, we briefly depart from conditional probabilities  and return back to generic distributions  and . Notice that the definition of KL divergence itself is an expected value expression. Also, note that  is a convex function— itself is concave, but the negative sign flips the concavity the other way. With these observations in mind, we can apply Jensen’s inequality to derive the following: Therefore, we have shown that KL divergence is always greater or equal to zero, which was our end goal. There is another version of a proof that I found a lot more intuitive and easier to follow than the previous approach. This derivation was borrowed from this post.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","As you can see, the loss seems to be decreasing for the most part, although it is jumpy at times. Indeed, plotting  makes it clear that the loss has been decreasing, though not entirely in a steady, monotonous fashion.  In retrospect, we could have probably added a batch normalization layer to stabilize and expedite training. However, since this post is largely meant as an introduction to PyTorch modeling, not model optimization or design, the example suffices. Now we have finally reached the last step of the development cycle: testing and evaluating the model. This last step will also require us to write a custom loop as we receive batches of data from the  object we’ve created above. The good news, however, is that the testing loop is not going to look too much different from the training loop; the only difference will be that we will not be backpropagating per each iteration. We will also be using  to make sure that the model is in the evaluation mode, not its default training mode. This ensures that things like batch normalization and dropout work correctly. Let’s talk briefly about the details of this loop. Here, the metric we’re collecting is accuracy. First, we generally see how many correct predictions the model generates.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Because we were dealing with a very simple example of biased coins, entropy values we calculated did not go past 1 bits, but we can easily imagine situations were it might, such as a dice roll or more complicated real-life examples. In this light, entropy is one metric with which we can quantify randomness, which is the mission we set out to accomplish in this post. But entropy is a lot more than just an interesting concept on randomness. Entropy has wide ranging applications, especially in the field of machine learning and neural networks. Among these, we will be looking at cross entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, two derivative concepts of entropy that are arguably most commonly used. Let’s start with the big picture first—when these concepts are used, what is the relationship between the two, why they are important—and move onto the details later. First, we have to know that cross entropy, unlike just entropy, deals with two probability distributions instead of one. Specifically, cross entropy is a way of measuring the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. In a typical scenario, we might have a true probability distribution  that we are trying to model, and our deep learning algorithm might produce some approximate probability distribution . We might evaluate the effectiveness of our model by calculating the distance between  and . Seen in this light, cross entropy can be interpreted as a target cost function to be minimized.

Note that feature engineering is also applied to both the training and test set simultaneously. We have created two new features, namely  and . Let’s go ahead and perform feature engineering on the  column as well to squeeze out more information. Now we have some data that seems a lot more workable.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"Because this function has to perform more tasks than the functions we wrote earlier, the example code is slightly longer, but here it goes: Basically, the  function counts the number of labels of each class and stores the results in a dictionary.

Although this process is not necessary, it helps us interpret the results in terms of percentages. For example, the example below tells us that approximately 71 percent of the neighbors of  are labeled 0; 28 percent are labeled 1. Now we have all the building blocks we need. We can stop here, but let’s nicely wrap all the functions we have build into a single function that we can use to train and test data.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"At a glance, this distribution resembles the binomial distribution we looked at earlier, and indeed that is no coincidence: the Poisson distribution is essentially a special case of binomial distributions whereby the number of trials is literally pushed to the limit. As stated earlier, the binomial distribution can be considered as a very rough approximation of the Poisson distribution, and the accuracy of approximation would be expected to increase as  increases. So let me ask the question again: how lucky was I yesterday? The probability distribution function of the Poisson distribution tells us that  can be calculated through the following equation: The result given by the Poisson distribution is somewhat larger than that derived from the binomial distribution, which was . This discrepancy notwithstanding, the fact that I had a very lucky day yesterday does not change: I would have days like these once every 100 days, and those days surely don’t come often. But to really calculate how lucky I get for the next 18 months of my life in the military, we need to do a bit more: we need to also take into account the fact that receiving lesser than 5 calls on a shift also constitutes a lucky day.

Introduction to seq2seq models,"The data preparation steps might felt a little boring, as it’s just interacting with the torchtext API, but it’s necessary nonetheless. Now, it’s finally time for some modeling! A typical sequence-to-sequence model is, by design, composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in a sequence as input, processes it to formulate some hidden state, and eventually passes on that hidden state and cell state to the decoder. The underlying assumption here is that the hidden and cell states should be able to encode some long and short term memory of the encoder network. The decoder, by accepting these two states, should have an understanding of the input data. Based on this understanding, it is then trained to output a corresponding sequence. Let’s first take a look at the implementation of the encoder network. It is a simple LSTM model that consists of an embedding layer and an LSTM layer. At the end of the forward pass, we return the hidden and cell states. Note that  is the total length of the index of the source language. The decoder is similar to the encoder, but has a little more moving parts. On a high level, the decoder is also an LSTM model like the encoder. In particular, its LSTM layer is configured in such a way that it is able to accept the hidden and cell states from the encoder.

Fast Gradient Sign Method,"Note that we clamp the value of the perturbed image to have values between 0 and 1, since that is the valid range for a normalized pixel value. Next, we define a custom loop function that examines each image in the test loader and generates predictions. If the prediction is wrong in the first place without any perturbation, we move on; the point of an adversarial attack is to create an adversarial example from an innocuous example that the model would have otherwise predicted correctly. A key implementation detail is the fact that we set the  property of the image to be true so that we can later obtain the gradients for the input. We then back propagate on the loss to obtain the gradient values, then create a perturbed image using the  function we have defined above. For demonstration purposes, we store the first few successful adversarial examples in a list. We also calculate the accuracy of the model and return that value as well. Now we’re done! Let’s define some epsilon values and run the test. Intuitively, we would expect the accuracy of the model to go down as the epsilon value increases; a higher epsilon value corresponds to a larger perturbation, which could more adversely impact the model. Through the print statements, we see that our initial predictions are indeed correct. A simple visualization also helps us see how quickly this drop in accuracy happens.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"Welcome to part three of the “from scratch” series where we implement machine learning models from the ground up. The model we will implement today, called the naive Bayes classifier, is an interesting model that nicely builds on top of the Bayesian mindset we developed in the previous post on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Much like the logistic regression model, naive Bayes can be used to solve classification tasks, as opposed to regression in which case the goal is to predict a continuous variable. The main difference between logistic regression and naive Bayes is that naive Bayes is built on a probabilistic model instead of an optimization model such as graident descent. Hence, implementing naive Bayes is somewhat easier from a programming point of view. Enough of the prologue, let’s cut to the chase. To understand naive Bayes, we need not look further than Bayes’s theorem, which is probably the single most referenced theorem on this blog so far.

After all, don’t we want the model to simply learn the dataset labels? The motivation is that the teacher model possesses what the authors of the paper refer to as “dark knowledge.” To make this more concrete, let’s consider a simple example. Say we have trained a reasonably good model on the MNIST dataset. The model would, of course, accurately be able to predict which digit each image represents. If we show the model a 6, chances are, it will accurately predict that the number is a 6. No big deal here. The interesting part occurs when we look at its logits. After a softmax activation, we might expect to see something like  We can see that the network correctly outputs 6 as the most probably digit by assigning it the largest logit.

If you haven’t heard about this function before, you might be wondering what all the moons deal is about. Well, if we plot the data points, it will become a lot more obvious.

Our goal will be to build a neural network that is capable of determining whether a given point belongs to class 0 or class 1. In other words, this is a classic example of a binary classification problem. It is standard practice in any classification problem to convert class labels into one-hot encodeded vectors.

Given this information, how can we simulate the situation as a binomial distribution? First, we have to define what constitutes a success in this situation. While there might be other ways to go about this agenda, the most straightforward approach would be to define a phone call as a success.

Seen this way, we can finally delineate a definition of the Gamma distribution as follows, with a trivial substitution of parameters. If this derivation involving the Gamma function does not click with you, we can take the alternative route of starting from the functional definition of the Gamma distribution: the Gamma distribution models the waiting time until the occurrence of the th event in a Poisson process. In other words, given some rate  which denotes the rate at which an event occurs, what is the distribution of the waiting time going to look like? The Gamma distribution holds an answer to this question. Let’s jump right into derivation. The first ingredient we need is the equation for the Poisson probability mass function, which we might recall goes as follows:  denotes the number of events that occur in unit time, while  denotes the rate of success. To generalize this formula by removing the unit time constraint, we can perform a rescaling on  to produce the following: where  denotes the probability that  events occur within time .

Gaussian Process Regression,"Therefore, we see little variation on test points near the data.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Because computing the softmax function require exponentiation, it is likely for the computer to end up with very large numerical quantities, making calculations unstable. One way to solve this problem is by subtracting values from the exponent.

Therefore, we can prevent numbers from getting too large by subtracting some value from the exponent, thus yielding accurate results from stable computation.

As per the experiment outlined in the original paper, we define a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers, each with 1200 units. The teacher network also uses dropout for regularization. Next up is the student model. The student model is a smaller version of the teacher network. It has two hidden layers, but 800 units as opposed to 1200. It also does not employ any dropout. To get a sense of how large the teacher model is in comparison to the student network, let’s count the number of trainable parameters in each. Below is a function that accomplishes this task. Now we can check how many parameters the teacher and student models have. From this comparison, we can see that the student model is roughly half the size of the teacher model. We could consider this percentage the degree of compression we wish to perform through knowledge distillation. This is where all the fun stuff happens. First, let’s implement the knowledge distillation loss function as defined in (3). Note that we don’t calculate the weighted average yet; we simply return the two loss sub-components. The first component, , is no different from loss value calculations we saw in typical classification tasks.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Principal Component Analysis,"The setup of a classic PCA problem might be summarized as follows. Suppose we have a dataset of  points, each living in -dimensional space. In other words,

We might imagine this as a transformation, i.e. the objective is to find a transformation So that applying  will yield a new vector  living in lower dimensional space. We can also imagine there being a reverse transformation or a decoding function  that achieves Because PCA is in essence a linear transformation, it is most natural to express and understand it as a matrix. Let’s define this transformation as , and the matrix corresponding to the decoding . In other words, PCA makes a number of assumptions to simplify this problem. The most important assumption is that each column of  is orthogonal to each other. As we will see later in an alternate derivation with statistics, this has to do with the notion of covariance. Another restriction is that the columns of  must have a Euclidean norm of one. This constraint is necessary for us to find a unique matrix  that achieves compression—otherwise, we could have any multiples, leading to an infinite number of such matrices. We make one more convenient assumption about the given data points, . That is,  is assumed to have a mean of zero, i.e. . If this is not the case, we can easily perform standardization by subtracting the mean from the data.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"For those of you who haven’t already, I highly recommend reading the post, as we developed a good intuition of when Monte Carlo simulations can come in handy to deal with tasks of varying difficulty. To cut to the chase, Monte Carlo methods are used to solve intractable problems, or problems that require expensive computing. Instead of systematically deriving a closed-forrm solution, we can alternatively opt for a scheme of random sampling and hope that, with a sufficient sample size, we would eventually be able to derive an approximation of the parameter. Although this seems stupid at first, it is an incredibly powerful approach to solving many problems, including the one presented here involving posterior calculation in Bayesian inference. The  is one of the first Markov Chain Monte Carlo model that was developed in the late 20th century to simulate particle movement. More advanced MCMC models have been introduced since; however, the Metrapolis-Hastings algorithm still deserves our attention as it demonstrates the basis of how many Markov Chain Monte Carlo models operate. Let’s get into the details of the model. At the heart of Metrapolis-Hastings is the proposal distribution, which we use to simulate the Markov chain random walk part of the model. Setting the parameters for this proposal distribution can be done arbitrarily, i.e. we can set it to be any random numbers. Theoretically, regardless of the parameters of the proposal distribution, the MCMC model would give us the same result after infinite iterations of sampling.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Neural Style Transfer,"The Gram matrix, despite its fancy name, is something that you’ve already seen at some point in your study of linear algebra. Given some matrix , the Gram matrix can be calculated as More strictly speaking, given a set of vectors , a Gram matrix can be calculated such that So how does the Gram matrix encode the stylistic similarities or differences between two images? Before I attempt at an explanation in words, I recommend that you check out this Medium article, which has helped me wrapped my own head around the different dimensions involved in the style loss term. This Medium article has also helped me gain more intuition on why the style loss is the way it is. The motivating idea is that, given an image and a layer in the feature extractor model, the activations each encode information coming from a filter. The resulting feature maps, therefore, contain information about some feature the model has learned, such as the presence of some pattern, shape, or object. By flattening each feature map and constructing a matrix of activations , where  is the number of filters and  is the width times height of each activation, we can now construct the Gram matrix. Effectively, the Gram matrix is a dot product of each rows of ; thus, if some th and th features tend to co-occur,  will have a large value.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Principal Component Analysis,"Recall from (1) that reconstruction can be achieved by applying compression followed by a decoding operation: Since we know that  is just  and  is  by definition, we can express (1) in a different way. In retrospect, this is somewhat intuitive since  can roughly be thought of as a pseudo-orthonormal matrix—pseudo since there is no guarantee that it is a square matrix. Now, all that is left is to find the matrix . The way to go about this is to reconsider (3), the notion of minimizing data loss, given our findings in (6). In other words, Instead of considering a single observation, here we consider the design matrix in its entirety. Note that  is a design matrix whose rows correspond to a single observation. And because we are dealing with matrices, the Euclidean norm was replaced with its matrix equivalent, the Frobenius norm. Observe that the first term  can safely be removed from the argument since it is a constant with respect to ; let’s also change the argument of the minimum to the maximum given the negative sign. The Frobenius norm of a real matrix can be calculated as Therefore, The last equality is due to a useful property of trace, which is that we can cycle the order of matrices without changing its value.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"If there is one thing that the field of statistics wouldn’t be complete without, it’s probably normal distributions, otherwise referred to as “the bell curve.” The normal distribution was discovered and studied extensively by Carl Friedrich Gauss, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution. We have seen Gaussian distributions before in this blog, specifically on this post on likelihood and probability. However, normal distribution was introduced merely as an example back then. Today, we will put the Gaussian distribution on stage under undivided spotlight. Of course, it is impossible to cover everything about this topic, but it is my goal to use the mathematics we know to derive and understand this distribution in greater detail. Also, it’s just helpful to brush up on some multivariable calculus in a while. Let’s start with the simplest case, the univariate Gaussian distribution. The “univariate” part is just a fancier way of saying that we will dealing be dealing with one-dimensional random variables, i.e. the distribution is going to be plotted on a two-dimensional  plane. We make this seemingly trivial distinction to distinguish it from the multivariate Gaussian, which can be plotted on three-dimensional space or beyond. We’ll take a look at the multivariate normal distribution in a later section. For now, let’s derive the univariate case. One of the defining properties of data that are said to be normally distributed when the rate at which the frequencies decrement is proportional to its distance from the mean and the frequencies themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"All we have to do, therefore, is to compute the expected value of the integrand by randomly generating a series of numbers within the specified domain, plug those values into the function , and take their average. This is a very elementary function that simply generates a specified number of samples given  within the domain . These numbers are then plugged into the function , after which an unweighted mean of these values are computed to approximate an integral. Let’s test the accuracy of this crude Monte Carlo method by using our example of  computed earlier. The result is a very poor approximation that is way off, most likely because we only used ten randomly generated numbers. Much like earlier, however, we would expect Monte Carlo to perform better with larger samples. The example we have analyzed so far was a very simple one, so simple that we would probably have been better off calculating the integral by hand than writing code. That’s why it’s time to put our crude Monte Carlo to the test with integrals more difficult to compute. Consider the following expression: One might try calculating this integral through substitution or integration by parts, but let’s choose not to for the sake of our mental health. Instead, we can model the integrand in Python and ask Monte Carlo to do the work for us. Concretely, this process might look as follows.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"But how might this number change for a biased coin? We would not expect the entropy of the random variable given by the result of a biased coin to be 1. For example, consider a coin that always lands on heads. The entropy of the random variable in this case would be exactly 0 bits, since we don’t need any information to express an event that is certain. Let’s try to figure out this dynamic between success probability of  in a coin toss and entropy by creating a plot.  The first observation to make is that the graph is symmetrical. This is no surprise, since we would expect the entropy of a random variable involving a coin that lands tails with probability  to be equal to that which lands on heads with equal probability , i.e. whether the bias concerns heads or tails should not affect the calculation of entropy. Moreover, we see that the graph peaks when , meaning that a fair coin toss involves the most randomness. In other words, this translates to saying that a skewed distribution is less random and thus more predictable than a symmetric one. This makes sense, since the result of a biased coin is more predictable and less surprising than that of a fair one, with the extreme case being the coin that always lands on one side. Seen in this light, entropy is just the total amount of information content expressed by the distribution of a random variable.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"The equation for  is even simpler, since there is no matrix multiplication involved. Thus, the gradient flows backwards without any modification. Moving down a layer, we come across (6): Let’s begin by trying to find the gradient for . You might be wondering what the  term is doing in that equation. After all, isn’t that quantity precisely what we are trying to calculate? This is the one tricky yet also interesting part about RNN backpropagation. Recall that the whole point of a recurrent neural network is its use of variables from the previous forward pass. For example, we know that in the next forward pass,  will be concatenated with the input . In the backpropagation step corresponding to that forward pass, we would have computed ; thus, this gradient flows into the current backpropagation as well. Although this diagram applies to a standard RNN instead of an LSTM, the recurrent nature of backprop still stands. I present it here because I find this diagram to be very intuitive.  If you look at the right, the star represents the gradient from the last pass. If you look to the left, you will see that there is going to be a gradient for  that will eventually be passed over to the next backpropgation scheme. Since the forward pass is recurrent, so is the backward pass. Since we have , now it’s time to move further. Let’s derive the expression for the gradient for .

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"In fact, we can borrow the same notation we used for linear regression to frame logistic regression as follows: In other words, logistic regression can be understood as a process in which our goal is to find the weight coefficients in the equation above the best describe the given data set. Unlike in linear regression, where the predicted value is computed simply by passing the data as arguments into a linear function, logistic regression outputs numbers between 0 and 1, making binary classification possible. However, there is certainly an element of linearity involved, which is part of the reason why both linear and logistic regression models fall under a larger family of models called generalized linear models. Now that we know the basic maths behind logistic regression using the sigmoid function, it’s time to implement it via code. Welcome to the next part of the tutorial, where we start building the actual model from scratch. As always, it’s a good idea to have some dummy data ready for disposal so that we can develop some basic intuition about dimensionality of our data when handling inputs and outputs of our functions. Here is the data we used in the last post on k-nearest neighbors algorithm, slightly modified for the purposes of this post.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"Recall the formula for the univariate Gaussian that describes our data: Then, from (1), we know that the likelihood function is simply going to be a product of the univariate Gaussian distribution. More specifically, the log likelihood is going to be the sum of the logs of the Gaussian probability distribution function. There is the log likelihood function! All we need now is the log prior. Recall that the prior is a normal distribution centered around mean  with standard deviation of 1. In PDF terms, this translates to The log prior can simply be derived by casting the logarithmic function to the probability distribution function. Now we are ready to enter the maximization step of the sequence. To calculate the maximum of the posterior distribution, we need to derive the posterior and set the gradient equal to zero. For a more robust analysis, it would be required to show that the second derivative is smaller than 0, which is indeed true in this case. However, for the sake of simplicity of demonstration, we skip that process and move directly to calculating the gradient. Let’s rearrange the final equality in (7). From (8), we can finally derive an expression for . This value of the parameter is one that which maximizes the posterior distribution.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"This can be seen by simply interpreting the posterior from a conditional probability point of view: the posterior denotes the probability of the value of the model parameter is  given data . Put differently, the value of  that maximizes the posterior is the optimal parameter value that best explains the sample observations. This is why at its heart, MAP is not so much different from MLE: although MLE is frequentist while MAP is Bayesian, the underlying objective of the two methods are fundamentally identical. And indeed, this similarity can also be seen through math. And we see that (5) is almost identical to (3), the formula for MLE! The only part where (5) differs is the inclusion of an additional term in the end, the log prior. What does this difference intuitively mean? Simply put, if we specify a prior distribution for the model parameter, the likelihood is no longer just determined by the likelihood of each data point, but also weighted by the specified prior. Consider the prior as an additional “constraint”, construed in a loose sense. The optimal parameter not only has to conform to the given data, but also not deviate too much from the established prior. To get a more intuitive hold of the role that a Bayesian prior plays in MAP, let’s assume the simplest, most uninformative prior we can consider: the uniform distribution. A uniform prior conveys zero beliefs about the distribution of the parameter, i.e. all values of  are equally probable.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Likelihood and Probability,"This code block creates two distributions of different parameters,  and . Then, we assume that a sample of value 1 is observed. Then, we can compare the likelihood of the two parameters given this data by comparing the probability density of the data for each of the two distributions. In this case,  seems more likely, i.e. it better explains the data  since , which is larger than . To sum up, likelihood is something that we can say about a distribution, specifically the parameter of the distribution. On the other hand, probabilities are quantities that we ascribe to individual data. Although these two concepts are easy to conflate, and indeed there exists an important relationship between them explained by Bayes’ theorem, yet they should not be conflated in the world of mathematics. At the end of the day, both of them provide interesting ways to analyze the organic relationship between data and distributions. Maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE in short, is an important technique used in many subfields of statistics, most notably Bayesian statistics. As the name suggests, the goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the parameters of a distribution that maximizes the probability of observing some given data . In other words, we want to find the optimal way to fit a distribution to the data. As our intuition suggests, MLE quickly reduces into an optimization problem, the solution of which can be obtained through various means, such as Newton’s method or gradient descent.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"First, let’s begin slow and easy by deriving the expressions for the derivative of the sigmoid and the  functions.

One useful fact about  is the fact that it is in fact nothing more than just a rescaled sigmoid. This relationship becomes a bit more apparent when we graph the two functions side by side.  Let’s refer to the definition of  to derive an expression for its derivative (no pun intended). Now comes the more complicated part. Thankfully, we’ve already done something very similar in the past when we were building a vanilla neural network from scratch. For instance, we know from this post that, given a cross entropy loss function, the gradient of the softmax layer can simply be calculated by subtracting the predicted probability from the true distribution. In other words, given an intermediate variable we know that Note that  is denoted as  in the code segment.

MLE and KL Divergence,"These days, I’ve been spending some time trying to read published research papers on neural networks to gain a more solid understanding of the math behind deep learning. This is a rewarding yet also a very challenging endeavor, mostly because I have not studied enough math to really understand all of what is going on. While reading the groundbreaking research paper Wasserstein GAN by Martin Arjovsky, I came across this phrase: … asymptotically, maximum likelihood estimation amounts to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence… I was particularly interested in the last portion of this sentence, that MLE amounts to minimizing KL divergence. We discussed MLE multiple time on this blog, including this introductory post and a related post on MAP. Neither is KL divergence an entirely unfamiliar topic. However, I had not thought about these two concepts together in one setting. In this post, let’s try to hash out what the quote from the paper means. Let’s start with a very quick review of what MLE and KL divergence each are. After all, it’s been a while since I’ve written the linked posts, and for a fruitful, substantive discussion on this topic, it’s necessary to make sure that we have a solid grasp of what MLE and KL divergence are. MLE is a technique used to find the optimal parameter of a distribution that best describes a set of data.

Gaussian Process Regression,"Then, we can now establish the following: where  denotes the observed values in the training set and the s are each components of the kernel matrix for the entire dataset, including both the training and test sets: This partition also means that  is the kernel for the training set; , the kernel for the test set. You might be wondering how the generic formula for the conditional distribution morphed into (18). While the notation might obscure their similarity, (18) immediately follows from (1). First, because we assumed zero mean, the term  simply collapses into . The same line of reasoning applies to ’ hence, the first term disappears from the mean. As for the covariance, a simple comparison is enough to show that the two equations are identical. In a nutshell, GP regression simply amounts to generating a prediction given some training data through conditioning, under the assumption that the underlying function is a infinite-dimensional vector that follows some Gaussian distribution with a kernel acting as its prior. Given this broad conceptual understanding, let’s move onto more concrete implementations. These are the setting we will be using for this post. We set a random seed for reproducibility purposes. Recall that, depsite its beautiful underlying complexity, all there is to GP regression is to identify some conditional Gaussian with a kernel as its covariance.

Nevertheless, it’s finally here and ready to go. In this post, we will take a look at the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the simplest variant among the family of MCMC models. Let’s see what the Bayesian hype is all about. It’s been a while since we last discussed Bayesian inference, so it’s probably a good idea to start with a brief recap.

With just a few lines of code, we can perform the exact same operation we performed above. In fact, let’s compare our Metropolis-Hastings sampler with the built-in function in the  library.  Pretty similar, wouldn’t you say? Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a powerful method with which we can estimate intractable posterior distributions. It is undoubtedly one of the most important tools that a Bayesian statistician should have under their belt.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"We can now plug this function into our crude Monte Carlo  and hope that the algorithm will provide us with an accurate estimation of this expression. So we have a number! But how do we know if this is an accurate estimation? Unlike in previous problems, where we already knew the true value of our estimate and measured the error of our simulation by comparing it with the known value, the true value of the integral expression is unknown in this problem because we have not evaluated the integral by hand. One way we can go about this dilemma is to calculate variance. Intuitively, if our estimate is indeed accurate, running the same Monte Carlo simulation would yield a value very similar to that of the previous. Conversely, if our estimate is inaccurate, the variance would be large, suggesting that our estimate has not converged to a value yet. Indeed, this is exactly what we attempted to visualize with the error plot above in our  estimation example. However, in most cases where Monte Carlo methods are used, we have no idea about the true value of the quantity we wish to estimate, like the complicated integral problem in this case, which is why we cannot simply calculate error by substracting our estimate from the true value.

Now it’s time for us to connect the dots between KL divergence and Fisher’s matrix. Before we diving right into computations, let’s think about how or why these two concepts might be related at all. One somewhat obvious link is that both quantities deal with likelihood, or to be more precise, log likelihood. Due to the definition of entropy, KL divergence ends up having a log likelihood term, while Fisher’s matrix is the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood function, or the covariance matrix of Fisher’s score, which is the gradient of the log likelihood. Either way, we know that likelihood is the fundamental bridge connecting the two. Let’s try to compute the KL divergence between  and .",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Principal Component Analysis,"I found this to be the more dominant interpretation of PCA, since indeed it is highly intuitive: the goal of PCA is to find the axes—or the principal components—that which maximize the variance seen in the data. setosa.io has some excellent visualizations on the notion of covariance and how it relates to PCA, so I highly recommend that you go check it out. If were to derive PCA from the gecko with the covariance approach, we would be using an iterative approach to find a single principal component at a time. Specifically, our goal would be to find  that which maximizes Hence the problem is now framed as a constrained optimization problem. We use Lagrangians to solve constrained optimization. The intuition for the Lagrangian method is that the gradient of the constraint and the argument should be parallel to each other at the point of optimization. We go about this by taking the gradient of the argument with respect to : Since 2 is just a constant, we can absorb it into  to form a more concise expression. Also, since the covariance matrix is by definition symmetric, we can simplify things further to end up with And once again, we have shown that the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","In the process, I got a little bit extra and also wrote a function that integrates a function in list index representation format. If we integrate , we end up with , where  is the integration constant. Excluding the integration constant, we get a result that is consistent with the  function. While it’s great that we can calculate derivatives and integrals, one very obvious drawback of this direct approach is that we cannot deal with non-polynomial functions, such as exponentials or logarithms. Moreover, the list index representation is unable to represent polynomials that include terms whose powers are not positive integers. For these reasons, we will need some other methods of calculating derivatives as well. Hence the motivation for approximation methods, outlined in the section below. If you probe the deepest depths of your memory, somewhere you will recall the following equation, which I’m sure all of us saw in some high school calculus class: This equation, commonly known as the definition of a derivative, is also known as the forward divided difference formula of calculating derivatives. There is another variant, known as the backward divided difference formula: (1) and (2) are almost nearly identical, but the difference lies in which term is subtracted from who. In (1), we go an infinitesimal step forward—hence the —and subtract the value at the point of approximation, . In (2), we go backwards, which is why we get .

The Math Behind GANs,"This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence: The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function , we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words,  and  should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator  is thus one that which is able to mimic  to model a compelling model distribution . In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless. I hope you enjoyed reading this post.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"In a previous post, we took a look at autoencoders, a type of neural network that receives some data as input, encodes them into a latent representation, and decodes this information to restore the original input. Autoencoders are exciting in and of themselves, but things can get a lot more interesting if we apply a bit of twist. In this post, we will take a look at one of the many flavors of the autoencoder model, known as variational autoencoders, or VAE for short. Specifically, the model that we will build in this tutorial is a convolutional variational Autoencoder, since we will be using convolutional layers for better image processing. The model architecture introduced in this tutorial was heavily inspired by the one outlined in François Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python, as well as that from a separate article on the Keras blog. Let’s start by importing the modules necessary for this demonstration. The objective of today’s task is to build an autoencoder model that produces MNIST hand-written digits. The hidden dimension, or the latent space of the model, is going to a random vector living in two-dimensional space. Let’s specify this setup, along with some other miscellaneous configurations, before we proceed with constructing the model architecture. It’s time to build our model… or not quite now.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"If the output of an algorithm given some data point is larger than 0.5, it is likely that the given input is a spam; if it is smaller than the 0.5 threshold, chances are the email is not spam. Let’s take a look at the shape of the sigmoid function, which is a special case of the logistic function that we will use throughout this post. To plot the sigmoid function, we need to import some libraries. The sigmoid function is defined as follows: We can express this as a Python function, as demonstrated in the code snippet below. Let’s quickly plot the graph to see what the sigmoid function looks like.  As we can see, the sigmoid is a smooth, differentiable function that is bounded between 0 and 1. It is also symmetrical around the point , which is why we can use 0.5 as a threshold for determining the class of a given data point. The logistic regression model uses the sigmoid function to generate predictions, but how exactly does it work?

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Using (11), we can proceed in a different direction from the definition of KL divergence. Once again, we have shown that KL divergence is positive! Proving this isn’t really necessary in the grand scheme of exploring the mathematics behind VAEs, yet I thought it would help to have this adjunctive section to better understand KL divergence and familiarize ourselves with some standard algebraic manipulations that are frequently invoked in many derivations. Let’s jump back into variational inference and defining the cost function with ELBO. Recall from the setup of our Variational Autoencoder model that we have defined the latent vector as living in two-dimensional space following a multivariate Gaussian distribution. It’s time to apply the ELBO equation to this specific context and derive a closed-form expression of our loss function. Let’s recall the formula for ELBO: After some rearranging, we can decompose ELBO into two terms, one of which is a KL divergence: Now, it’s finally time for us to dive deep into math: let’s unpack the closed form expression in (13). Note that the ELBO expression applies to just about any distribution, but since we chose a multivariate Gaussian to be the base distribution, we will see how it unfolds specifically in this context.

The Exponential Family,"Normal, binomial, exponential, gamma, beta, poisson… These are just some of the many probability distributions that show up on just about any statistics textbook. Until now, I knew that there existed some connections between these distributions, such as the fact that a binomial distribution simulates multiple Bernoulli trials, or that the continuous random variable equivalent of the geometric distribution is the exponential. However, reading about the concept of the exponential family of distributions has lent me new insight, and I wish to share that renewed understanding on probability distributions through this post. In this section, we will take a look at what the exponential family of distributions is all about. We will begin by laying out a few mathematical definitions, then proceed to see examples of probability distributions that belong to the exponential family. To cut to the chase, the exponential family simply denotes a  group of probability distributions that satisfy a certain condition, namely that they can be factorized and parametrized into a  specific form, as show below: Here,  is a log noramlizing constant that ensures that the probability distribution integrates to 1. There are other alternative forms that express the same factorization. One such variant that I prefer and find more intuitive uses a simple fractional approach for normalization instead of adding complications to the exponential term. For notational convenience, I will follow the fractional normalization approach shown below throughout this post.

Word2vec from Scratch,"In a previous post, we discussed how we can use tf-idf vectorization to encode documents into vectors. While probing more into this topic and geting a taste of what NLP is like, I decided to take a jab at another closely related, classic topic in NLP: word2vec. word2vec is a technique introduced by Google engineers in 2013, popularized by statements such as “king - man + woman = queen.” The gist of it, as you may know, is that we can express words as vectors that encode their semantics in a meaningful way. When I was just getting starting to learn TensorFlow, I came across the embedding layer, which performed exactly this operation: transforming words into vectors. While I thought this process was extremely interesting, I didn’t know about the internals of this structure until today, particularly after reading this wonderful tutorial by Chris McCornick. In this post, we will be implementing word2vec, a popular embedding technique, from scratch with NumPy. Let’s get started! Instead of going over the concepts and implementations separately, let’s jump straight into the whole implementation process and elaborate on what is necessary along the way. In order to create word embeddings, we need some sort of data. Here is a text on machine learning from Wikipedia. I’ve removed some parentheses and citation brackets to make things slightly easier.

Word2vec from Scratch,"However, the good news is that we have already derived the equation for backpropagation given a softmax layer with cross entropy loss in this post, where we built a neural network from scratch. The conclusion of the lengthy derivation was ultimately that given our model Since we know the error, we can now backpropagate it throughout the entire network, recalling basic principles of matrix calculus. If backprop is still confusing to you due to all the tranposes going on, one pro-tip is to think in terms of dimensions. After all, the dimension of the gradient must equal to the dimension of the original matrix. With that in mind, let’s implement the backpropagation function. To keep a log of the value of the error throughout the backpropagation process, I decided to make the final return value of  to be the cross entropy loss between the prediction and the target labels. The cross entropy loss function can easily be implemented as follows. Now we’re ready to train and test the model! As we only have a small number of training data—coupled with the fact that the backpropagation algorithm is simple batch gradient descent—let’s just iterate for 50 epochs. While training, we will be caching the value of the cross entropy error function in a  list. We can then plot this result to get a better sense of whether the training worked properly.

(Attempt at) Knowledge Distillation,"To cut to the chase, the loss function in knowledge distillation is a combined loss of weighted averages: the cross entropy between the student model outputs and labels, as well as the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the temperature-adjusted student and teacher model logits. More concisely, where  denotes the softmax function,  denotes softmax prime with adjusted temperature,  denotes the raw logits of the teacher model, and  is a weighted average parameter. While this might seem like a lot, in reality it is just the weighted average of the normal cross entropy loss that we would use in typical training, combined with the KL divergence loss between the temperature-adjusted softmax outputs of the student and teacher model. Intuitively, we can understand the KL divergence as an additional form of regularization that forces the student network to not only train on hard ground-truth labels, but also the dark knowledge coming from the outputs of the teacher model. Now that we have an overall idea of how knowledge distillation works, let’s start implementing knowledge distillation training. Before we move on, full disclaimer that this experiment did not go as I had expected. As you will see below, somehow the distilled student model ended up outperforming the teacher, which is something that normally does not happen. In a later section, I will try to provide some hypotheses as to why this happened. Let’s import necessary modules for this tutorial. We define a transformation we will be applying to each image.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"This is the motivation behind the notion of a natural gradient. Now you might be wondering how all this has anything to do with the Fisher matrix, which we looked at in the previous post. Well, it turns out there are some deep, interesting questions to be posed and connections to be uncovered. If we’re going to search around the distribution space, one natural question to consider is what distance metric we will use for our search. In case of batch gradient descent, we used Euclidean distance. This made sense since we were simply measuring the distance between two parameters, which are effectively scalars or vector quantities. If we want to search the distribution space, on the other hand, we would have to measure the distance between two probability distributions, one that is defined by the previous parameter and the other defined by the newly found parameter after natural gradient descent. Well, we know one great candidate for this task right off the bat, and that is KL divergence. Recall that KL divergence is a way of quantifying the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. The formula for KL divergence is shown below. And while we’re at it, let’s throw cross entropy and entropy into the picture as well, both for review and clarity’s sake: For a short, simple review of these concepts, refer to this previous article, or Aurelien Geron’s video on YouTube.

The Gibbs Sampler,"Heuristically, we know that the addition in  will become a multiplication when plugged back into the original formula for the multivariate Gaussian as shown in (3), using (4).

Using this heuristic, we conclude that Notice that this result is exactly what we have in the function which we used to sample from the conditional distribution. The Gibbs sampler is another very interesting algorithm we can use to sample from complicated, intractable distributions. Although the use case of the Gibbs sampler is somewhat limited due to the fact that we need to be able to access the conditional distribution, it is a powerful algorithm nonetheless. We also discussed the notion of conditional distributions of the multivariate Gaussian in this post. The derivation was not the simplest, and granted we omitted a lot of algebra along the way, but it was a good mental exercise nonetheless.

Fisher Score and Information,"The next step, as we all know, is to take the derivative of the term in the argument maxima, set it equal to zero, and voila! We have found the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. A quick aside that may become later is the fact that maximizing the likelihood amounts to minimizing the loss function. Now here comes the definition of Fisher’s score function, which really is nothing more than what we’ve done above: it’s just the gradient of the log likelihood function. In other words, we have already been implicitly using Fisher’s score to find the maximum of the likelihood function all along, just without explicitly using the term. Fisher’s score is simply the gradient or the derivative of the log likelihood function, which means that setting the score equal to zero gives us the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. An important characteristic to note about Fisher’s score is the fact that the score evaluated the true value of the parameter equals zero. Concretely, this means that given a true parameter , This might seem deceptively obvious: after all, the whole point of Fisher’s score and maximum likelihood estimation is to find a parameter value that would set the gradient equal to zero. This is exactly what I had thought, but there are subtle intricacies taking place here that deserves our attention.

Introduction to seq2seq models,"It’s also helpful to see what’s actually in each of these splits. Let’s take a look at the very first data in the training set.

By calling  on each field, we can tell torchtext which vocabulary to keep. Internally, this process triggers each field to have , or token to index and , the reverse lookup. We can see that the vocabulary includes not only the words actually in the dataset, but also special tokens such as start, end, and padding tokens. The  attribute gives us access to the entire vocabulary in each of the fields. We can see that the German vocabulary is slightly larger than English. Let’s also quickly check the  dictionary to see if we can obtain index values. We can see that the start token is the second in the lookup table. Using , we can batch these field datasets into their PyTorch data loader equivalents. Let’s set a batch size and create some iterators. With batching, we get 128 examples at once. The zeroth index of the batch, as can be seen below, is a list containing 128 2’s. This is because 2 is the index that corresponds to the starting token.

The Math Behind GANs,"Binary cross entropy fulfills our objective in that it measures how different two distributions are in the context of binary classification of determining whether an input data point is true or false. Applying this to the loss functions in (1), We can do the same for (2): Now we have two loss functions with which to train the generator and the discriminator! Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if  is close to 1, since . This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach. The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above. Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped. Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse. In other words, The min-max formulation is a concise one-liner that intuitively demonstrates the adversarial nature of thecompetition between the generator and the discriminator.

For convenience purposes, we will represent cities by their indices. Now it’s time for us to understand how genetic algorithms work. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a biology major to understand this; simple intuition will do. The idea is that, we can use some sort of randomized approach to generate an initial population, and motivate an evolutionary cycle such that only superior genes will survive successive iterations. You might be wondering what genes are in this context. Most typically, genes can be thought of as some representation of the solution we are trying to find. In this case, an encoding of the optimal path would be the gene we are looking for. Evolution is a process that finds an optimal solution for survival through competition and mutation. Basically, the genes that have superior traits will survive, leaving offspring into the next generation. Those that are inferior will be unable to find a mate and perish, as sad as it sounds. Then how do these superior or inferior traits occur in the first place? The answer lies in random mutations.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"So far on this blog, we have looked the mathematics behind distributions, most notably binomial, Poisson, and Gamma, with a little bit of exponential. These distributions are interesting in and of themselves, but their true beauty shines through when we analyze them under the light of Bayesian inference. In today’s post, we first develop an intuition for conditional probabilities to derive Bayes’ theorem. From there, we  motivate the method of Bayesian inference as a means of understanding probability. Suppose a man believes he may have been affected with a flu after days of fever and coughing. At the nearest hospital, he is offered to undergo a clinical examination that is known to have an accuracy of 90 percent, i.e. it will return positive results to positive cases 90 percent of the time. However, it is also known that the test produces false positives 50 percent of the time. In other words, a healthy, unaffected individual will test positive with a probability of 50 percent. In cases like these, conditional probability is a great way to package and represent information. Conditional probability refers to a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred. Mathematically, we can define the conditional probability of event  given  as follows: This equation simple states that the conditional probability of  given  is the fraction of the marginal probability  and the area of intersection between those two events, .",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"To put this into perspective, let’s compare the objectives of a generative model with that of a discriminative model. Simply put, the goal of a discriminative model is to model and calculate where  is a label and  is some input vector. As you can see, discriminative models arise most commonly from the context of supervised machine learning, such as regression or classification. In contrast, the goal of a generative model is to approximate the distribution which we might construe to be the probability of observing evidence or data. By modeling this distribution, the goal is that we might be able to generate samples that appear to have been sampled from this distribution. In other words, we want our model to generate likely data points based on an approximation of the true distribution from which these observations came from. In the context of this tutorial, our neural network  should be able to somewhat immitate the speech of the famous German philosopher based on the training it went through with text data, although we would not expect the content generated by our neural network to have the same level of depth and profoundity as those of his original writings.

A PyTorch Primer,"Let’s remind ourselves of Kera’s basic sequential model API: Now let’s compare this method with PyTorch’s way of declaring sequential models: This model declaration is in fact exactly identical to the simple model we have declared above. You can easily see how similar this code snippet is to the Keras example. The only difference is that the activation function is declared independently of the layer itself in PyTorch, whereas Keras combines them into one via  argument. Of course, you don’t have to specify this argument, and we can import the ReLU function from TensorFlow to make it explicit like the PyTorch example. The point, however, is that the sequential model API for both libraries are pretty similar. Another way to build models is by subclassing . The  submodule in PyTorch is the one that deals with neural networks; hence the . This subclassing might look as follows: This model is no different from the  we defined earlier.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"We can see this in practice by reapplying Bayes’ theorem with updated information, as shown below: We see that the value of the conditional probability has indeed increased, lending credence to the idea that the man is sick. Like this, Like this, Bayes’ theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to calculate conditional probabilities and to update them continuously through repeated trials. From a Bayesian perspective, we begin with some expectation, or prior probability, that an event will occur. We then update this prior probability by computing conditional probabilities with new information obtained for each trial, the result of which yields a posterior probability. This posterior probability can then be used as a new prior probability for subsequent analysis. In this light, Bayesian statistics offers a new way to compute new information and update our beliefs about an event in probabilistic terms. Bayesian inference is nothing more than an extension of Bayes’ theorem. The biggest difference between the two is that Bayesian inference mainly deals with probability distributions instead of point probabilities. The case of the potential patient we analyzed above was a simple yet illuminating example, but it was limiting in that we assumed all parameters to be simple constants, such as  for test accuracy and  for false positive frequency.

Fisher Score and Information,"Using the Leibniz rule we saw earlier, we can interchange the derivative and come up with the following expressions. Granted, these expressions somewhat muffle the shape of the quantity we are dealing with, namely vectors and matrices, but it is concise and intuitive enough for our purposes. With these statements in mind, let’s now begin the derivation by first taking a look at the Hessian of the score function. From the chain rule, we know that This does not look good at all. However, let’s not fall into despair, since our goal is not to calculate the second derivative or the Hessian itself, but rather its negative expected value. In calculating the expected value, we will be using integrals, which is where the seemingly trivial statements we established earlier come in handy. By linearity of expectation, we can split this expectation up into two pieces. Let’s use integrals to express the first expectation. The good news is that now we see terms canceling out each other. Moreover, from the Leibniz rule and the interchanging of the integral and the derivative, we have shown that the integral in fact evaluates to zero.

Now, we’re finally ready to use these functions to randomly generate city coordinates and use the genetic algorithm to find the optimal path using  with the appropriate parameters. Let’s run the algorithm for a few iterations and plot its history.  We can see that the genetic algorithm does seems to be optimizing the path as we expect, since the distance metric seems to be decreasing throughout the iteration. Now, let’s actually try plotting the path along with the corresponding city coordinates. Here’s a helper function to print the optimal path. And calling this function, we obtain the following:  At a glance, it’s really difficult to see if this is indeed the optimal path, especially because the city coordinates were generated at random.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"We finished at then moved onto a discussion of variance and covariance. Now that we understand that the covariance matrix is the analogue of variance, we can substitute  with , the covariate matrix. Instead of leaving  at the denominator, let’s use the fact that to rearrange the expression. This is another example of when the matrix-scalar parallel intuition can come in handy: the scalar multiplicative identity is 1, whereas the equivalent in matrix world is the identity matrix . Therefore, the reciprocal of a matrix can be interpreted as its inverse. From this observation, we can conclude that We are almost done, but not quite. Recall the the constant coefficient of the probability distribution originates from the fact that We have to make some adjustments to the constant coefficient since, in the context of the multivariate Gaussian, the integral translates into While it may not be apparent immediately, it is not hard to accept that the correcting coefficient in this case has to be as there are  layers of iterated integrals to evaluate for each  through . Instead of the matrix , we use its determinant  since we need the coefficient to be a constant, not a matrix term. We don’t go into much detail about the derivation of the constant term; the bottom line is that we want the integral of the probability distribution function over the relevant domain to converge to 1.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"a head-biased coin; a larger , a tail-oriented one. When  and  take the same value, the local extrema of the Beta distribution is established at , when the coin is perfectly fair. Now that we have established the usability of the Beta function as a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function, let’s finally see Bayesian inference at work. Recall the simplified version of Bayes’ theorem for inference, given as follows: For the prior and the likelihood, we can now plug in the equations corresponding to each distribution to generate a new posterior. Notice that , which stands for data, is now given in the form  where  denotes the number of heads; , the total number of coin flips. Notice also that constants, such as the combinatorial expression or the reciprocal of the Beta function, can be dropped since we are only establishing a proportional relationship between the left and right hand sides. Further simplifications can be applied: But notice that this expression for the posterior can be encapsulated as a Beta distribution since Therefore, we started from a prior of  to end up with a posterior of . This is an incredibly powerful mechanism of updating our beliefs based on presented data. This process also proves that, as purported earlier, the Beta distribution is indeed a conjugate prior of a binomial likelihood function. Now, it’s time to put our theory to the test with concrete numbers. Suppose we start our experiment with completely no expectation as to the fairness of the coin.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Neural Style Transfer,"So I decided to try out other sample implementations of NMT to see how using more advanced NMT algorithms could make things any better. I decided to try out fast neural style transform, which is available on the official PyTorch GitHub repository. Fast NMT is one of the more advanced, recent algorithms that have been studied after the original NMT algorithm, which we’ve implemente above, was introduced. One of the many benefits of fast neural style transfer is that, instead of framing NMT as an optimization problem, FNMT makes it a modeling problem. In this instance, TransformerNet is a pretrained model that can transform images into their stylized equivalents. The code below was borrowed from the PyTorch repository. I decided to try out FNMT on a number of different pictures of myself, just to see how different results would be for each. Here, we loop through the directory and obtain the file path to each content photo. And here are the results!  Among the 20 photos that have been stylized, I think some definitely look better than others. In particular, I think the third row looks kind of scary, as it made every photo have red hues all over my face. However, there are definitely ones that look good as well. Overall, FNMT using pretrained models definitely yielded better results than our implementation. Of course, this is expected since the original NMT was not the most efficient algorithm; perhaps we will explore FNMT in a future post.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
PyTorch Tensor Basics,"If we apply  to , we essentially add a new dimension to the 0-th position of ’s shape. As you can see, now there is an additional batch dimension, thus resulting in a tensor whose shape is  as opposed to the original . However, of course this operation is not performed in-place, meaning that  will still remain unchanged. There are in-place versions of both  and  though, and that is simply adding a  to the end of the function. For example, Equivalently, calling  will remove the th dimension of the tensor. By default,  is 0. Squeezing and unsqueezing can get handy when dealing with single images, or just single inputs in general. Concatenation and stacking are very commonly used in deep learning. Yet they are also operations that I often had trouble imagining in my head, largely because concatenation can happen along many axes or dimensions. In this section, let’s solidify our understanding of what concatenation really achieves with some dummy examples. With a basic example, we can quickly verify that each tensor is a three-dimensional tensor whose individual elements are two-dimensional tensors of shape . Now, let’s perform the first concatenation along the 0-th dimension, or the batch dimension. We can verify that the concatenation occurred along the 0-th dimension by checking the shape of the resulting tensor. Since we concatenated two tensors each of shape , we would expect the resulting tensor to have the shape of , which is indeed what we got.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"The  function loads the CIFAR10 data set from  module, then applies some basic preprocessing to make it more usable for deep learning purposes. The CIFAR10 data set contains 50000 training images, each labeled with 1 of 10 classes, ranging from cats, horses, and trucks to airplanes. This is a classic classification task. The preprocessing occurs on two levels: first, the images are normalized so that its pixels takes values between 0 and 1. The training labels are transformed from an integer class label to a one-hot encoded vector. Let’s load the data to proceed with our analysis. Let’s see what the dimensions of the data are. Because the CIFAR10 data set include color images for its training set, we would expect three channels, each corresponding to red, green, and blue (hence RGB). As expected, it appears that the training data is a tensor of four dimensions, while the target labels are 10 dimensional vectors. To get a better idea of what the CIFAR10 data looks like, here is a basic function that will display the images in the data set for us using . We can see that, although the images are very pixelated, it is somewhat possible to make out what each image is showing. Of course, this task is going to be a lot more difficult for our neural network.  Now is finally the time to buid the neural network.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"This tutorial is a continuation of the “from scratch” series we started last time with the blog post demonstrating the implementation of a simple k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The machine learning model we will be looking at today is logistic regression. If the “regression” part sounds familiar, yes, that is because logistic regression is a close cousin of linear regression—both models are employed in the context of regression problems. Linear regression is used when the estimation parameter is a continuous variable; logistic regression is best suited to tackle binary classification problems. Implementing the logistic regression model is slightly more challenging due to the mathematics involved in gradient descent, but we will make every step explicit throughout the way. Without further ado, let’s get into it. To understand the clockwork behind logistic regression, it is necessary to understand the logistic function. Simply put, the logistic function is a s-shaped curve the squishes real values between positive and negative infinity into the range . This property is convenient from a machine learning perspective because it allows us to perform binary classification. Binary classification is a type of classification problem where we are assigned the task of categorizing data into two groups. For instance, given the dimensions of a patient’s tumor, determine whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Another problem might involve classifying emails as either spam or not spam. We can label spam emails as 1 and non-spam emails as 0, feed the data into a predefined machine learning algorithm, and generate predictions using that model.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
PyTorch Tensor Basics,"This is a very quick post in which I familiarize myself with basic tensor operations in PyTorch while also documenting and clarifying details that initially confused me. As you may realize, some of these points of confusion are rather minute details, while others concern important core operations that are commonly used. This document may grow as I start to use PyTorch more extensively for training or model implementation. Let’s get started. There appear to be two ways of specifying the size of a tensor. Using  as an example, let’s consider the difference between and It confused me how the two yielded identical results. Indeed, we can even verify that the two tensors are identical via I thought different behaviors would be expected if I passed in more dimensions, plus some additional arguments like , but this was not true. The conclusion of this analysis is that the two ways of specifying the size of a tensor are exactly identical. However, one note of caution is that NumPy is more opinionated than PyTorch and exclusively favors the tuple approach over the unpacked one. The conclusion of this analysis is that either approach is fine; it is perhaps a good idea to stick to one convention and stay consistent with that coding style throughout. Resizing or reshaping a tensor is an incredibly important tensor operation that is used all the time. The interesting thing is that there seems to be many ways of achieving the same behavior.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"Notice that introducing this new parameter does not alter the fundamental shape or path of the vector ; it merely specifies the speed at which the particle is traversing the complex plane. You might recall from high school physics that the velocity vector is a derivative of the position vector with respect to time. In other words, Where  is a vector that denotes the position of an object at time . Now, let’s assume that  is such a position vector. Then, it follows from the principles of physics that its derivative will be a velocity vector. Therefore, we have What is so special about this velocity vector? For one, we can see that it is a scalar multiple of the original position vector, . Upon closer examination, we might also convince ourselves that this vector is in fact orthogonal to the position vector. This is because multiplying a point or vector by  in the complex plane effectively flips the object’s  and  components, which is precisely what a 90 degree rotation entails. What does it mean to have a trajectory whose instantaneous velocity is perpendicular to that of the position vector? Hint: think of planetary orbits. Yes, that’s right: this relationship is characteristic of circular motions, a type of movement in which an object rotates around a center of axis. The position vector of a circular motion points outward from the center of rotation, and the velocity vector is tangential to the circular trajectory.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"At the Yongsan Provost Marshall Office, I receive a wide variety of calls during my shift. Some of them are part of routine communications, such as gate checks or facility operation checks. Others are more spontaneous; fire alarm reports come in from time to time, along with calls from the Korean National Police about intoxicated soldiers who get involved in mutual assault or misdemeanors of the likes. Once, I got a call from the American Red Cross about a suicidal attempt of a soldier off post. All combined, I typically find myself answering about ten to fifteen calls per shift. But yesterday was a special day, a good one indeed, because I received only five calls in total. This not only meant that USAG-Yongsan was safe and sound, but also that I had a relatively light workload. On other days when lawlessness prevails over order, the PMO quickly descends into chaos—patrols get dispatched, the desk sergeant files mountains of paperwork, and I find myself responding to countless phone calls while relaying relevant information to senior officials, first sergeants, and the Korean National Police. So yesterday got me thinking: what is the probability that I get only five calls within a time frame of eight hours, given some estimate of the average number of calls received by the PMO, say 12?

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","In the example below, we show that using  results in a very similar value (in fact, it is identical in this case, but we need to take into other factors such as numerical stability and overflow which might happen with such high-precision numbers). This result aligns with the earlier observation that center divided difference provides very accurate approximations of the first derivative. Note that the advantage of using  is that we can now apply Newton-Raphson to non-polynomial equations that cannot be formulated in list index representation format. For instance, let’s try something like . To verify that this is indeed correct, we can plug  back into . Also, given that , we can use some heuristics to realize that the answer must be only ever so slightly larger than 1. Notice that the result is extremely close to zero, suggesting that we have found the correct root. Now that we have seen the robustness of the Newton-Raphson method, let’s take a look at another similar numerical method that uses backward divided difference for derivative approximation. In this section, we will look at the secant method, which is another method for identifying the roots of non-linear equations. Before we get into a description of how this method works, here’s a quick graphic, again from Wikipedia, on how the secant method works.  As the name implies, the secant function works by drawing secant lines that cross the function at each iteration.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Likelihood and Probability,"But first, let’s clarify the fact that  is probability density, not probability. Moreover, the interpretation of probability density in the context of likelihood is different from that which arises when we discuss probability; likelihood attempts to explain the fit of observed data by altering the distribution parameter. Probability, in contrast, primarily deals with the question of how probable the observed data is given some parameter . Likelihood and probability, therefore, seem to ask similar questions, but in fact they approach the same phenomenon from opposite angles, one with a focus on the parameter and the other on data. Let’s develop more intuition by analyzing the difference between likelihood and probability from a graphical standpoint. To get started, recall the that This is the good old definition of probability as defined for a continuous random varriable , given some probability density function  with parameter . Graphically speaking, we can consider probability as the area or volume under the probability density function, which may be a curve, plane, or a hyperplane depending on the dimensionality of our context. Unlike probability, likelihood is best understood as a point estimate on the PDF. Imagine having two disparate distributions with distinct parameters. Likelihood is an estimate we can use to see which of these two distributions better explain the data we have in our hands. Intuitively, the closer the mean of the distribution is to the observed data point, the more likely the parameters for the distribution would be. We can see this in action with a simple line of code.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Principal Component Analysis,"With this setup in mind, let’s finally start the derivation. As said earlier, the goal of PCA is to compress data (and be able to uncompress it) with as little loss of information as possible. We don’t want to compress data in a haphazard fashion; instead, we want the compression scheme to be able to preserve the structure of the data as much as possible in its lower dimensional representation. From this, we can come up with the following equation: In other words, the goal is to find  that which minimizes the difference between the original data and the reconstructed data. Note that finding this optimal  amounts to finding  that most effectively compresses given data. Instead of the L2 norm, let’s consider the squared L2 norm for convenience purposes. Note that minimizing the L2 norm is equal to minimizing the squared L2 norm, so there is no semantic difference. By definition of vector transpose, we can now express the squared L2 norm versions of (3) as follows: where the second to last equality is due to the fact that  and  are both constants that denote the same value. Also,  the argument of the minimum is with respect to , we can omit the first term, which is purely in terms of . It’s time to take derivatives.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"In that context, a class label of 2 is not at all related to adding two data points belonging to class 1, or any arithmatic operation of that kind. To prevent our model from making such arbitrary, unhelpful connections, we convert class labels to one-hot encoded vectors. We could use external libraries such as  to invoke the  function, but instead let’s just build a function ourselves since this is a relatively simple task. Let’s test the  function on the training data. We don’t need the entire data to see that it works, so let’s slice the  array to see its first five elements. When we apply  to the data, we see that the returned result is a two-dimensional array containing one-hot encoded vectors, as intended. That’s all the data and the preprocessing we will need for now. Activation functions are important aspects of neural networks. In fact, it is what allows neural networks to model nonlinearities in data. As we will see in the next section, a neural network is essentially composed of layers and weights that can be expressed as matrix multiplications. No matter how complex a matrix may be, matrix multiplication is a linear operation, which means that is impossible to model nonlinearities. This is where activation functions kick in: by applying nonlinear transformation to layer outputs, we can make neural networks capable of modeling nonlinearities.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
MLE and KL Divergence,"d) samples as shown below: Then, LLN states that A more precise statement of the law uses Chebyshev’s inequality: For the curious, here is the general formulation of Chebyshev’s inequality outside the context of LLN: For the purpose of this post, it is not necessary to go into how Chebyshev’s inequality is derived or what it means. However, it isn’t difficult to see how one might reformulate (8) to derive (7) to prove the Law of Large Numbers. All that the inequality is saying is that no more than a certain fraction of samples can fall outside more than a certain distance away from the mean of the distribution. With this understanding in mind, let’s return to the original problem and wrap up the proof. Let’s apply the Law of Large Numbers to modify the expected value expression sitting in (5): Voila! We have shown that minimizing the KL divergence amounts to finding the maximum likelihood estimate of . This was not the shortest of journeys, but it is interesting to see how the two concepts are related. Indeed, it sort of makes intuitive sense to think that minimizing the distance between the true and approximated distribution is best done through maximum likelihood estimation, which is a technique used to find the parameter of the distribution that best describes given data. I personally find little derivations and proofs like these to be quite interesting, which is why I plan on doing more posts on the mathematics of deep learning and its related concepts in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Word2vec from Scratch,"What is the value that we are trying to approximate, and what sort of input will we be feeding into the model to generate predictions? The answer to these questions and how they tie into word2vec is at the heart of understanding word embeddings—as you may be able to tell, word2vec is not some sort of blackbox magic, but a result of careful training with input and output values, just like any other machine learning task. So here comes the crux of word2vec: we loop through each word (or token) in the sentence. In each loop, we look at words to the left and right of the input word, as shown below. This illustration was taken from this article by Ramzi Karam.  In the particular example as shown above, we would generate the following input and prediction pairs part of the training data. Note that the window size is two, which is why we look up to two words to the left and right of the input word. So in a way, we can understand this as forcing the model to understand a rough sense of context—the ability to see which words tend to stick together. In our own example, for instance, we would see a lot of , meaning that the model should be able to capture the close contextual affinity between these two words.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"For each walk, function will generate a random number to determine the direrction of his movement. The magnitude of each walk is 1 by default.

If his moves are legal, we continue with the movement; if not, we stop and assume that the trial has yielded a failure.

Introduction to tf-idf,"This is all there is to it—in fact, the formula for tf-idf can simply be expressed as where  denotes a single term; , a singe document, and , a collection of documents. So simply put, tf-idf is simply a product of the term frequency, denoted above as , and inverse document frequency, . All there is left, then, is to figure out what term frequency and inverse document frequency are. Without much explanation, you can probably guess what term frequency is: it simply indicates how frequently a word appeared in a given document. For example, if there were a total of 3 distinct words in a document (very short, I know), then each of the three words would have a tf score of . Put differently, the sum of the tf vector for each document should sum to one. The definition of a tf score might be thus expressed as where the denominator denotes the count of all occurrences of the term  in document , and the numerator represents the total number of terms in the document. Roughly speaking, inverse document frequency is simply the reciprocal of document frequency. Therefore, it suffices to show what document frequency is, since idf would immediately follow from df. Before getting into the formula, I think it’s instructive to consider the motivation behind tf-idf, and in particular what role idf plays in the final score.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Checking data types is necessary both for imputation and general data preprocessing. Specifically, we need to pay attention as to whether a given column encodes categorical or numerical variables. For example, we can’t use the mean to impute categorical variables; instead, something like the mode would make much more sense. The best way to determine whether a variable is categorical or not is simply to use domain knowledge and actually observe the data. Of course, one might use hacky methods like the one below: Although you might think that this is a working hack, this approach is in fact highly dangerous, even in this toy example. For example, consider , which is supposedly a numerical variable of type . However, earlier with , we saw that  is in fact a ordinal variable taking discrete values, one of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. So hacky methods must not be used in isolation; at the very least, they need to be complemented with some form of human input. Let’s try to use a simple pipeline to deal with missing values in some categorical variables. This is going to be our first sneak peak at how pipelines are declared and used. Here, we have declared a three-step pipeline: an imputer, one-hot encoder, and principal component analysis.

Complex Fibonacci,"With some algebra, one can verify that Putting these together, we finally get Binet’s formula: An interesting point to note about Binet’s formula is that  doesn’t necessarily have to be a non-negative integer as we had previously assumed. In fact, it can be any number: rational, irrational, real, or even complex. The fact that the fibonacci numbers can extend to real number indexing becomes more apparent once we code out the formula. Nothing special at all, this is just a literal transcription of the formula presented above. But now, watch what happens when we try to get the 1.1th fibonacci number, for instance: Lo and behold, we get a complex fibonacci number! I thought this was so fascinating, almost like seeing a magic of some sort. Although I had known about the fibonacci sequence for as long as I can remember, I had never thought about it in continuous terms: in my mind, the fibonacci sequence was, after all, a sequence—a discrete set of numbers adhering to the simple rule that the next number in line is the sum of the previous two. The intriguing part is that, even in this complex fibonacci madness, the simple rule still holds.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Let’s start out by taking a look at the sampling function we will use to define one of the layers of the variational Autoencoder network.

As you can guess from the name of the variables, these two  parameters refer to the mean and log variance of the random vector living in our predefined latent space. Note that we are assuming a diagonal Gaussian here: in other words, the covariance matrix of the multi-dimensional Gaussian is assumed to be diagonal, meaning that each elements of the vector are independent. If any of this sounds foreign to you, I recommend that you read this post on the Gaussian distribution. Let’s continue our discussion with the sampling function. The goal here is to sample a random vector in the latent space from the distribution specified by the two parameters, mean and log variance. The sampling process can be expressed as follows: where  denotes the mean, corresponding to ,  denotes a tensor of random numbers sampled from the standard normal distribution, and  denotes the standard deviation (we will see how this is related to  in just a moment). Essentially, the goal here is to use a resampling technique such that we can sample from a standard normal distribution centered around mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1, but consequentially sample from a distribution of  living in the latent space.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"A good way to understand this data is through visualization. Let’s try to visualize what the distribution of  and  looks like for data labeled class .

Therefore, we can imagine data points for class  to be distributed across a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution whose center lies at the point where the the plot has the darkest color, i.e. . I find this way of understanding data to be highly intuitive in this context. Now, it’s time to bake Bayesian philosophy into code. Recall that to perform Bayesian analysis, we first need to specify a prior. Although we could use an uninformed prior, in this case, we have data to work with. The way that makes the most sense would be to count the number of data points corresponding to each class to create a categorical distribution and use that as our prior, as shown below. If we use the  created from , we should get a very simple prior whereby  since there is an equal number of data points belonging to the two classes in the toy data set. Indeed, this seems to be true.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Let’s take a look at the posterior distribution for each bandit. We can easily plot them using , as shown below. Notice that I have also included the uniform prior for reference purposes.  The result is as we would expect: the bandit with the highest success parameter of 0.7 seems to have been pulled on the most, which explains why its variance is the smallest out of the bunch. Moreover, the mean of that particular posterior is also close to 0.7, its true value. Notice that the rest of the posteriors also somewhat have this trend, although more uncertainty is reflected into the shape of the distributions via the spread. It is interesting to see how we can go from a uniform prior, or , to almost normal-shaped distributions as we see above. To corroborate our intuition that the best bandit was indeed the most pulled, let’s quickly see the proportion of the pulls through a pie chart.  As you can see, there seems to be a positive correlation between the success parameter and the number of pulls. This is certainly good, since we want the gambler to pull on the best bandit the majority of times while avoiding the worse ones as much as possible. This certainly seems to be the case, given that the bandit with the worse parameter—0.1—was pulled the least.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"We begin with the likelihood ratio: We can consider  as representing how probable the sample  came from distribution  than , given that  was sampled from some unknown distribution. If , the more likely it is that the data came from ; if , the more probable it is that the sample came from . Say we have multiple independent observations of data. Then, we can use (6) to compute the likelihood ratio for each sample. Calculating the product of these ratios will tell us which distribution is more likely given all available data points. In other words, A technique we saw when we were exploring the topic of likelihood maximization was log likelihood. Log likelihoods are useful because we can reexpress products as sums, using the property of logs. (7) makes sense, but it weighs all likelihood ratios equally. In reality, most samples are not equiprobable; some values are more likely than others, unless in the context of uniform distributions. To account for this, let’s reframe (7) as an expected values calculation, i.e. give different weight to each likelihood ratio depending on the probability of observing that data point.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"I say almost, because we still have not dealt with the trailing term in (13): At this point, it is extremely useful to recall the definition of cross entropy, which is generically defined as follows: Therefore, we see that the trailing term in (13) is just a cross entropy between two distributions! This was a circumlocutions journey, but that is enough math we will need for this tutorial. It’s time to get back to coding. All that math was for this simple code snippet shown below: As you can see, this short code snippet shows, in essence, how we can define a compile a model with a custom loss function. In this case,  refers to the reconstruction loss, which is the cross entropy term we saw earlier. , as you might expect, simply refers to KL divergence. Notice how there is a  multiplying factor in the  expression, just like we did when we derived it in the section above. With some keen observations and comparisons, you will easily see that the code is merely a transcription of (13), with some minor differences given dimensionality. One important fact to note is that the gradient descent algorithm, by default, seeks to minimize the loss function. However, we discussed above how the objective of VAE is to maximize ELBO. Therefore, we modify ELBO into a loss function that is to be minimized by defining the loss function as the negative of ELBO.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The data set contains three target classes, labeled as integers from 0 to 2, and thirteen feature columns, listed below: As I am not a wine afficionado, I have no idea what some of these columns represent, but that is irrelevant to the purpose of this tutorial. Let’s jump right in by loading the data. It always a good idea to get a sense of what the data looks like by verifying its dimension. Note that we used the  function we wrote in previous posts to shuffle and slice the data into training and validation sets. For convenience, the code for this function is presented below. Now it’s finally time to check our model by making predictions. This can simply be done by passing the training and testing data set into the  function that represented our Gaussian naive Bayes model. Let’s check if the predicted class labels match the answer key, i.e. the  array. Eyeballing the results, it seems like we did reasonably well! In fact, the line below tells us that our model mislabeled only one test instance! We can quantify the performance our model through the metric of accuracy. The  function does this for us. Note that instead of using the for-loop approach used in previous posts, this function is more vectorized, making computation less expensive. The shorter code is also an added benefit.

Understanding PageRank,"Google is the most popular search engine in the world. It is so popular that the word “Google” has been  as a proper verb, denoting the act of searching on Google. While Google’s success as an Internet search engine might be attributed to a plethora of factors, the company’s famous PageRank algorithm is undoubtedly a contributing factor behind the stage.  is a method by which Google ranks different pages on the world wide web, displaying the most relevant and important pages on the top of the search result when a user inputs an entry. Simply put, PageRank determines which websites are most likely to contain the information the user is looking for and returns the most optimal search result. While the nuts and bolts of this algorithm may appear complicated—and indeed they are—the underlying concept is surprisingly intuitive: the relevance or importance of a page is determined by the number of hyperlinks going to and from the website. Let’s hash out this proposition by creating a miniature version of the Internet. In our microcosm, there are only five websites, represented as nodes on a network graph.

At the core of the  function is the  function, which is our implementation of back propagation. This provides a nice point of transition to the next section. Back propagation is a smart way of calculating gradients. There are obviously many ways one might go about gradient calculation. We can simply imagine there being a loss function that is a function of all the thousands of weights and biases making up our neural network, and calculate partial derivatives for each parameter. However, this naive aproach is problematic because it is so computationally expensive. Moreover, if you think about it for a second, you might realize that doing so would result in duplicate computations due to the chain rule. Take the simple example below. If we were to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to  and , all we need to compute is the gradient of , since that of  will naturally be obtained along the way.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Although I’m no science major, one of the few things that I recall from high school chemistry class is the Gibbs free energy equation for calculating the spontaneity of reactions, which went as follows: where the term for entropy, denoted as  satisfies the condition that We won’t get into the details of these equations, but an intuition that we can glean from this equation is that the randomness of a particle is determined by the number of potential states that are possible for that given particle. In other words, a gas particle that freely moves across space at ATP is going to be more random than a near-static water particle composing an ice cub. We might take a step further and say that the gas particle carries a larger amount of information than the particle in a solid since more information is required to express its randomness. Entropy in science, denoted above as , provides us with a valuable intuition on the topic of randomness and information. In fact, it is no coincidence that the notion of randomness in information theory, a subfield of math that we are going to be dipping our toes in, borrowed the term “entropy” to express randomness exhibited in data. Just like entropy was used to quantify randomness in the scientific phenomena, the notion of entropy is used in information theory to denote randomness in data. The origin of information entropy can be traced back to Claude Shannon’s paper published in 1948, titled “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","In hindsight, solving the Basel problem is not rocket science; it is a mere application of the Taylor polynomial, coupled with some modifications and operations to mold the problem into a specific form. However, it takes extreme clairvoyance to see the link between the Basel problem and the Taylor polynomial of the sine function. At this point, it doesn’t even surprise us to know that Euler applied this line of thinking to calculate the value of the sum of higher order inverses. An interesting corollary of Euler’s solution to the Basel problem is the Wallis product, which is a representation of the quantity  as an infinite product, as shown below: It seems mathematically unintuitive to say that an irrational number such as  can be expressed as a product of fractions, which is a way of representing rational numbers. However, we can verify the soundness of the Wallis product by substituting  for  in (1): Taking the reciprocal of this entire expression reveals the Wallis product. The Basel problem is a specific case of the Riemann zeta function, whose general form can be written as follows. A small digression: when , the zeta function converges to a value known as Apéry’s constant, eponymously named after the French mathematician who proved its irrationality in the late 20th century. Beyond the field of analytics and pure math, the zeta function is widely applied in fields such as physics and statistics. Perhaps we will explore these topics in the future.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Then, cross entropy would have been calculated as Indeed, we can use our function to verify the coherency of this statement. In other words, when our predicted distribution equals the true distribution we are trying to model, cross entropy becomes 0, as a desirable cost function would behave. This is why crosss entropy is often used in classification models where we have a one-hot encoded vector that represents a true distribution, as exemplified by , and a prediction that models this distribution, denoted as  in our example. It is not difficult to see why cross entropy is a useful cost function frequently used in the field of machine learning. Entropy is an interesting concept with which we can quantify randomness in data. This process is no rocket science, but simply a process that involves calculations with probabilities. Although the link may not be immediately apparent, randomness is just another way of expressing probabilities and uncertainty, and it is from this premise that information and entropy take off. Beyond that, however, entropy is now used extensively in the field of machine learning, specifically as a loss function. Although it was not noted explicitly above, cross entropy calculates the same quantity as the logarithmic loss function. Essentially, cross entropy is useful in that it provides us with some intuitive information of how far two distributions are apart.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"More generally, maximum likelihood estimation can be expressed as: It is not difficult to see why trying to compute this quantity may not be as easy as it seems: because we are dealing with probabilities, which are by definition smaller than 1, their product will quickly diverge to 0, which might cause arithmetic underflow. Therefore, we typically use log likelihoods instead. Maximizing the log likelihood amounts to maximizing the likelihood function since log is a monotonically increasing function. Finding the maximum could be achieved multiple ways, such as through derivation or gradient descent. As the name suggests, maximum a posteriori is an optimization method that seeks to maximize the posterior distribution in a Bayesian context, which we dealt with in this post. Recall the Bayesian analysis commences from a number of components, namely the prior, likelihood, evidence, and posterior. Concretely, The objective of Bayesian inference is to estimate the posterior distribution, whose probability distribution is often intractable, by computing the product of likelihood and the prior. This process could be repeated multiple times as more data flows in, which is how posterior update can be performed. We saw this mechanism in action with the example of a coin flip, given a binomial likelihood function and a beta prior, which are conjugate distribution pairs. Then what does maximizing the posterior mean in the context of MAP? With some thinking, we can convince ourselves that maximizing the posterior distribution amounts to finding the optimal parameters of a distribution that best describe the given data set.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Gaussian Process Regression,"I think this is the most fascinating part about GPs—as we will see later on, GPs do not require us to specify any function or model to fit the data. Instead, all we need to do is to identify the mean and covariance of a multivariate Gaussian that defines the posterior of the GP. All of this sounds too good be true—how can a single multivariate Gaussian distribution be enough for what could potentially be a high-dimensional, complicated regression problem? Let’s discuss some mathematical ideas that enable GP to be so powerful. Gaussians are essentially a black hole of distributions: once a Gaussian, always a Gaussian. For example, we know from a previous post on Gibbs sampling that the conditional of a multivariate Gaussian is also Gaussian. given the setup that and And of course, the marginal of a multivariate Gaussian also produces another Gaussian. This marginalization property can be understood both intuitively by thinking about the implications of viewing the mean and covariance as vectors and matrices, or by taking a direct integral: Lastly and most importantly, we also saw in the post on Bayesian linear regression that the product of two Gaussians is also Gaussian. Like this, a distribution that is Gaussian most likely stays Gaussian, withstanding such operations as marginalization, multiplication, or conditioning. This is a powerful property that we can use to motivate the “Gaussian-ness” behind GP. As stated earlier, GP is non-parametric.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In a previous post on Markov chains, we examined the clockwork behind eigendecomposition, a technique used to decompose non-degenerate square matrices. Singular value decomposition is similar to eigendecomposition in that it is a technique that can be used to factor matrices into distinct components. In fact, in deriving the SVD formula, we will later inevitably run into eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which should remind us of eigendecomposition. However, SVD is distinct from eigendecomposition in that it can be used to factor not only square matrices, but any matrices, whether square or rectangular, degenerate or non-singular. This wide applicability is what makes singular decomposition such a useful method of processing matrices. Now that we have a general idea of what SVD entails, let’s get down into the details. In this section, we take a look at the mathematical clockwork behind the SVD formula. In doing so, we might run into some concepts of linear algebra that requie us to understand some basic the properties of symmetric matrices. The first section is devoted to explaining the formula using these properties; the second section provides explanations and simple proofs for some of the properties that we reference duirng derivation.

The result shows us that we have correctly predicted 272 values while making wrong predictions in only 2 cases. Let’s systematize this quantity by creating a  function that returns how accurate our model is given  and . Let’s use this function to test how well our model performed. 99 percent is not a bad estimate at all. One interesting question to consider is how much boost in accuracy we see with each epoch, i.e. what is the bang-per-buck of each iteration cycle? This is an important question to consider because gradient descent is computationally expensive; if we can train our model in just 10 epochs instead of 1000, why not choose the former? To answer this question, let’s plot accuracy against epoch. For fun, I added the learning parameter  as an argument to the  function as well.

At , the  collapses to 1, resulting in an exponential distribution. A short tangential digression: the exponential distribution is a special case of a Gamma distribution that models the waiting time until the first event in a Poisson process. It can also be considered as the continuous version of the geometric distribution. But maybe more on this later on a separate post. Returning back to the Gamma distribution, we see that altering the  also produces a transformative effect on the shape of the Gamma PDF. Specifically, increasing  causes the distribution to move to the right along the -axis. This movement occurs because, for every , a larger  value results in a decrease in the corresponding value of , which graphically translates to a rightward movement along the axis as shown. We started by looking at the Poisson probability mass function, and started our venture into the Gamma function by pondering the question of interpolating the factorial function. From there, we were able to derive and develop an intuition for the Gamma distribution, which models the waiting time required until the occurrence of the th event in a Poisson process.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","However, I actually prefer this low-levelness because it requires me to really think through what is happening in each iteration, namely what the dimension of each batch is, what the model expects to receive as input in the forward computation, and what loss function is appropriate given the output and label. Let’s see what all of this means. First, we begin by actually initializing an instance of the model, a loss function named , and an , which is Adam in this case. A quick note of caution: if you dig into the PyTorch documentation or look at other example classifiers, you will realize, like me, there are two loss functions you can typically use:  and , or negative log likelihood loss. The difference between the former and latter is that, while the former applies a softmax function to the output before calculating the actual loss, the latter does not. In our case, since we simply output the raw logits instead of applying a softmax calculation, we need to use the former. Let’s return where we were. Before we jump into training and defining the training loop, it’s always a good idea to see if the output of the model is what you’d expect.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This is a highly intuitive restatement of the definition of conditional probability introduced above: given that event  has already occurred, conditional probability tells us the probability that event  occurs, which is then synonymous to that statement that  has occurred. By the same token, we can also define the reverse conditional probability of  given  through symmetry and substitution. Notice that the numerator stays unchanged since the operation of intersection is commutative. Now let’s develop an intuition for conditional probabilities by applying it to our example of clinical trials and the potentially affected patient. The purported accuracy of the clinical test is 90 percent, which we might express as follows, using the conditional probability notation: By the same token, we can also express the information on false positives as shown below. This conditional probability statement espouses that, given an individual who is not sick, the test returns a false positive 50 percent of the time. Conditional probability provides us with an interesting way to analyze given information. For instance, let  be the event that it rains tomorrow, and  be the event that it is cloudy at the present moment.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Based on our earlier mathematical analysis, we would expect this convergence to get even better as we expand out the  range, with an upper bound that is greater than the current 200.  While jumping around in Wikipedia, I came across the Dirichlet Eta function, which is a slight variant of the Riemann Zeta function. This function looks as follows: As you can see, this is essentially the alternating version of the Riemann Zeta function. Given this design, we can derive what may appear to be apparent to some yet nonetheless interesting relationship between the Eta and Zeta. Deriving this relationship requires a very similar operation to the sieving or factorizing we performed earlier to derive the probabilistic interpretation of the Zeta function. For a bit of intuition, observe that the Eta function can be split up into what may be referred to as even and odd terms. In other words, The idea is that the even terms are just a multiple of the Zeta function, namely Then, the odd terms can also be seen as the Zeta function minus this multiple: We now have successfully expressed both the even and odd terms of the Eta function in terms of the Zeta function.

Understanding the  Leibniz Rule,"Before I begin, I must say that this video by Brian Storey at Olin College is the most intuitive explanation of the Leibniz rule I have seen so far. Granted, my greedy search over the internet space was by no means exhaustive, so I’ve probably missed some other hidden gems  here and there. Also, the video is intended as a visual explanation for beginners rather than a robust analytical proof of the Leibniz rule. This point notwithstanding, I highly recommend that you check out the video. This post is going to provide a short, condensed summary of the proof presented in the video, minus the fancy visualization that pen and paper can afford. The Leibniz rule, sometimes referred to as Feynman’s rule or differentiation-under-the-integral-sign-rule, is an interesting, highly useful way of computing complicated integrals. A simple version of the Leibniz rule might be stated as follows: As you can see, what this rule essentially tells us is that integrals and derivatives are interchangeable under mild conditions. We’ve used this rule many times in a previous post on Fisher’s information matrix when computing expected values that involved derivatives. Why is this the case?

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"In a previous post, we briefly explored the notion of Markov chains and their application to Google’s PageRank algorithm. Today, we will attempt to understand the Markov process from a more mathematical standpoint by meshing it together the concept of eigenvectors. This post was inspired and in part adapted from this source. In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a linear transformation is roughly defined as follows: a nonzero vector that is mapped by a given linear transformation onto a vector that is the scalar multiple of itself This definition, while seemingly abstract and cryptic, distills down into a simple equation when written in matrix form: Here,  denotes the matrix representing a linear transformation; , the eignevector; , the scalar value that is multiplied onto the eigenvector. Simply put, an eigenvector  of a linear transformation is one that is—allow me to use this term in the loosest sense to encompass positive, negative, and even imaginary scalar values—“stretched” by some factor  when the transformation is applied, i.e. multiplied by the matrix  which maps the given linear transformation. The easiest example I like to employ to demonstrate this concept is the identity matrix . For the purpose of demonstration, let  be an arbritrary vector  and  the three-by-three identity matrix.

Introduction to tf-idf,"In this process, we will also convert all documents to lower case as well. Note that  works on each documents, not the entire collection. Let’s try calling the function with the first document in our dummy example. Finally, as part of the preprocessing step, let’s build the corpus. The corpus simply refers to the entire set of words in the dataset. Specifically for our purposes, the corpus will be a dictionary whose keys are the words and values are an ordinal index. Another way to think about the corpus in this context is to consider it as a word-to-index mapping. We will be using the indices to represent each word in the tf, idf, and tf-idf vectors later on in the tutorial. Because we have a very simple example, our corpus only contains 9 words. This also means that our tf-idf vectors for each document will also be a list of length 9. Thus it isn’t difficult to see how tf-idf vectorization can result in extremely high-dimensional matrices, which is why we often apply techniques such as lemmatization or PCA on the final result. Also note that published modules use sparse representations to minimize computational load, as we will later see with scikit-learn.

In Python, this simply amounts to looping through each document, creating a tf vector per iteration, and making sure that they are normalized as frequencies at the very end.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"But if our LSTM network only keeps forgetting, obviously this is going to be problematic. Instead, we also want to update the cell state using the new input values.

Taking a look at the second term, we note that the term is adding some value to the cell state that has been updated to forget information. It only makes sense, then, for the second term to perform the information update sequence. But to understand the second term, we need to take a look at two other equations: (2) is another forward pass involving concatenation, much like we saw in (1) with .

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The trace plot below shows that, although the MCMC model does manage to sample many values, it likes to stay too much in its current state, thus making taking much longer for the sampler to properly estimate the posterior by sampling a wide range of values. The bottom line is that setting the right proposal distribution is important, and that trace plots are a good place to start to check if the proposal distribution is set up properly.  Now, it’s time to look at the answer key and see if our sampler has done well. Let’s plot  sampled by our Metropolis-Hastings sampler with the analytic posterior to see if they roughly match.  Fantastic! Although the estimated posterior is not exactly equal to the analytic posterior, the two are quite similar to each other. We could quantify how similar or different they are by using metrics such as , but for simplicity’s sake, let’s contain the post within the realm of Bayes as we have done so far. This goes to show just how useful and powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo can be: even if a complicated likelihood function in high dimensional space, we would be able to use a similar sampling sequence to estimate the posterior.

Better seq2seq,"In the previous post, we took a look at how to implement a basic sequence-to-sequence model in PyTorch. Today, we will be implementing a small improvement to the previous model. These improvements were suggested in Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, by Cho, et. al. To cut to the chase, the image below, taken from Ben Trevett’s tutorial, encapsulates the enhancement we will be implementing today.  In the previous model, the hidden state of the model was a bottleneck: all the information from the encoder was supposed to be compressed into the hidden state, and even that encoder hidden state would have undergone changes as the decoder was unrolled with subsequent target sequences. To reduce this bottleneck and lessen the compression burden on the encoder hidden state, the improved architecture will allow the decoder to gain access to the encoder hidden state at each time step. Moreover, the final classifier output layer in decoder will have access to the original embedding of the target language token as well as the last hidden state of the encoder, represented as  in the diagram above. This can be considered a residual connection, since the embedding skips the RNN and directly gets fed into the fully connected layer.

The easiest way to go about this is to use the  method, which looks like this: Here, we are applying to transformations: the first changes the dataset and casts it into PyTorch tensors,, and the second one normalizes the dataset to have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of also 0.5 across all three channels of RGB. How can we apply this transform? Well, we can pass it to initialize the datasets as shown below: Because I already have the CIFAR10 downloaded in the  directory of my local, PyTorch does not download the dataset again. We could go with the dataset as-is, but we can use the  class to further batch and shuffle the dataset, which we normally want 99 percent of the time.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
So What are Autoencoders?,"For experimental puposes, I tried using the  callback on Google Colab.  is a platform that gives developers full view of what happens during and after the training process. It makes observing metrics like loss and accuracy a breeze. I highly recommend that you check out this tutorial on how to use and configure this functionality on your notebook. Now that the training is over, what can we do with this autoencoder? Well, let’s see if the autoencoder is now capable of removing noise from tainted image files. But before we jump right into that, let’s first build a simple function that displays images for our convenience. Using the  function, we can now display 25 test images that we will feed into the autoencoder.  Let’s add noise to the data.  Finally, the time has come! The autoencoder will try to “denoise” the contaminated images. Let’s see if it does a good job.  Lo and behold, the autoencoder produces pristine images, almost reverting them back to their original state! I find autoencoders interesting for two reasons. First, they can be used to compress images into lower dimensions. Our original image was of size 28-by-28, summing up to a total of 784 pixels. Somehow, the autoencoder finds ways to decompress this image into vectors living in the predefined 128 dimensions. This is interesting in and of itself, since it presents ways that we might be able to compress large files with minimal loss of information.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Introduction to seq2seq models,"The structure is almost identical to that of the training loop, except that set the model to evaluation mode and execute every forward pass within the  statement. Now, we train the model! We save the model weights if the validation loss is higher than the best validation loss prior to the current iteration. Because I wrote all of this code locally, I didn’t train the model. I did run the training loop a few time in Google Colab, but even that took a while. I decided that I’d save my GPU quota for more interesting models later. The end goal of this tutorial was to gain a deeper understanding of how encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence models are implemented. I remember reading about neural machine translation through the TensorFlow website around a year ago when I was first learning deep learning with Keras, and it’s just great to see that I’ve made enough progress to be able to understand, digest, and model a basic sequence-to-sequence NMT model with PyTorch. But again, the model we have implemented today is extremely simple in terms of its design, and there are many more enhancements we can apply to it. In the coming posts, we will be taking a look at some better, more advanced seq2seq models that implement features like attention. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this post. Catch you up in the next one!.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The accuray score yielded by  is exactly identical to that achieved by our model! Looks like the  model in scikit-learn does exactly what our model does, at least juding from the metric of accuracy. This is surprising, but since we basically followed the Bayesian line of reasoning to buid our model, which is what naive Bayes really is all about, perhaps this is not as astonishing as it seems. In this post, we built the Gaussian naive Bayes model from scratch. In the process, we reviewed key concepts such as Bayesian inference and maximum a posteriori estimation, both of which are key statistical concepts used in many subdomains of machine learning. Hopefully through this tutorial, you gained a better understanding of how Gaussian mathematics and Bayesian thinking can be used in the context of classification. The true power of naive Bayes is not limited to the task of classificaiton, however. In fact, it is used in many fields, most notably natural language processing. Perhaps we might look into the possible applications of naive Bayes in the context of NLP in a future post. But for now, this level of modeling will do. Thanks for reading. See you in the next post!.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
BLEU from scratch,"This is where BLEU comes to the rescue. The way BLEU works is simple. Given some candidate translation of a sentence and a group of reference sentences, we use a bag-of-word approach to see how many occurences of BOWs co-occur in both the translation and reference sentences. BOW is a simple yet highly effective way of ensuring that the machine translation contains key phrases or words that reference translations also contain. In other words, BLEU compares candidate translations with human-produced, annotated reference translations and compares how many hits there are in the candidate sentence. The more BOW hits there are, the better the translation. Of course, there are many more details that go beyond this. For instance, BLEU is able to account for situations in which meaningless words are repeated throughout the machine translation to simply increase BOW hits. It can also penalize translations that are too short. By combining this BOW precision-based approach with some penalization terms, BLEU provides a robust means of evaluating machine translations. With this high-level overview in mind, let’s start implementing BLEU from scratch. First, let’s begin by defining some simple preprocessing and helper functions that we will be using throughout this tutorial. The first on the list is , which converts a given sentence into lowercase and splits it into tokens, which are, in this case, English words. We could make this more robust using regular expressions to remove punctuations, but for the purposes of this demonstration, let’s make this simpler.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
My First GAN,"Now that we have an idea of what the function accomplishes, let’s use it to start training. The  seems to fluctuate a bit, which is not necessarily a good sign but also quite a common phenomenon in GAN training. GANs are notoriously difficult to train, since it requires balancing the performance of the generator and the discriminator in such a way that one does not overpower the other. This is referred to as a min-max game in game theory terms, and finding an equilibrium in such structures are known to be difficult. Let’s take a look at the results now that the iterations are over.  The created images are admittedly fuzzy, pixelated, and some even somewhat alien-looking. This point notwithstanding, I find it incredibly fascinating to see that at least some generated images actually resemble ships in the sea. Of particular interest to me are the red ships that appear in  and . Given the simplicity of the structure of our network, I would say that this is a successful result. Let’s take a look at the learning curve of the GAN.  As you might expect, the loss is very spiky and erratic. This is why it is hard to determine when to stop training a GAN. Of course, there are obvious signs of failure: when the loss of one component starts to get exponentially larger or smaller than its competitor, for instance. However, this did not happen here, so I let the training continue until the specified number of interactions were over.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","However, this is obviously not the most systematic approach, and there is not even a clear guideline as to how they should go about pulling these levers. Here is where the Bayesian approach comes in handy. It isn’t difficult to frame this as a Bayesian problem. Given a pull of the slot machine, the result of which we will denote as , a Bernoulli random variable, we can then formulate the problem as follows: And as the classical Bayesian analysis goes, the more data we collect through repeated experiments, the closer the posterior distribution will get to the target distribution. Through this process, we are able to approximate the parameter . Now we have to think about what distributions we want to use for the prior and likelihood. Let’s start with the easier one: the likelihood. The natural choice that makes sense is the binomial distribution. Each pull on the lever can be considered a Bernoulli trial, and as we start exploring with more pulls to accumulate data, we will essentially be sampling from a binomial distribution, with  success and  failures out of a total of  trials. Therefore, more concretely, we can say The more interesting part is the prior distribution. Intuitively, the one might be inclined to say that we need a uniform prior, and indeed that answer would technically be true. However, I qualify with “technically” since the real answer has an added layer of complexity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"05, 0.1, and 0.5. Just like before, we cap the number of iterations to 200 epochs.  The graph shows that the larger the learning rate, the quicker the decrease in cross entropy loss. This result is coherent with what the previous visualizations on accuracy suggested: the higher the learning rate, the quicker the model learns from the training data. In this post, we built the logistic regression model from scratch by deriving an equation for gradient descent on cross entropy given a sigmoid function. In the process, we brought together many useful concepts we explored on this blog previously, such as matrix calculus, cross entropy, and more. It’s always exciting to see when seemingly unrelated concepts come together to form beautiful pictures in unexpected ways, and that is what motivates me to continue my journey down this road. The logistic regression model is simple yet incredibly powerful in the context of binary classification. As we saw earlier with the application of the model to the task of bank notes authentication, the logistic regression model can, when tweaked with the appropriate parameters, make surprisingly accurate predictions given sufficient amount of training data. Of course, the processing of training and tweaking is not always easy because we have to determine some hyperparameters, most notably the learning rate of the gradient descent algorithm, but the fact that logistic regression is a robust model is unchanged nonetheless. Hopefully this post gave you some idea of what happens behind the scene in a regression-based machine learning model.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"A corollary of this simple analysis is that we can now express the probability that a given random number will be a prime number as follows, using (6): In other words, the reciprocal of the Zeta function tells us the probability that a randomly chosen number will be a prime! The more interesting part of the story is that, we can now extend this single-number example to the case of multiple numbers. The only difference is that, instead of considering whether a single number is prime or not, we will consider the notion of coprimeness, or relative primeness. Imagine we randomly sample  numbers, ranging from  all the way up to . What is the probability that these  numbers are all coprime to each other, i.e. the greatest common divisor for these numbers is 1? With some rumination, it isn’t difficult to convince ourselves that this probability can be expressed as Let’s think for a second why this is the case. The probability that some prime number  divides all  through  is going to be , as dividing each number can be considered an independent event. Therefore, the probability that some prime number  does not divide all numbers—i.e. it may divide none or some, but definitely not all—can be expressed as the complement of , or equivalently, . If we apply this analysis to all prime numbers, we end up with (6). Now, let’s simulate the process of random sampling to empirically verify the probabilistic interpretation of the Riemann Zeta function.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
