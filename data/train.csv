Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The idea is that we want to get a dot product of the weight vector and the data vector, then plug the resulting value into the sigmoid function to get some value between 0 and 1. The  function shown below exactly performs this task, with the added caveat that it returns a label prediction when the boolean argument  is set to ; a raw sigmoid output when the same is set to . Let’s perform a quick sanity check by using some dummy weight vector. Using the coefficients in the  list, we can generate predictions for each observation in the . The actual class information is stored in the  list. The dummy coefficients are poorly optimized, which is why the predicted class labels do not align well with the actual class labels. This tells us that more tuning is required to update the coefficients and build a robust logistic regression model. But how exactly can we tune our model? Simply eyeballing the actual and predicted labels of our data is probably not going to help us much. To optimize the coefficients to best fit our data, we need to construct some loss function—that is, a function that describes how badly our model is performing. Then, we can optimize the weights of our model by minimizing that loss function, which would mean that our model gradually makes better predictions with each round of optimization. If you recall the previous post on entropy, you will remember that we discussed a concept called cross entropy.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"In reality, most statistical estimates exist as probability distributions since there are limitations to our ability to measure and survey data from the population. For example, a simple random sampling of the population might reveal that 15 percent of the sample population is affected with the flu, but this would most likely produce a normal distribution with mean centered around 0.15 instead of a point probability. From a Bayesian standpoint, we would then replace the point probability in our example above with an equation for the distribution, from which we can proceed with the Bayesian analysis of updating our prior with the posterior through repeated testing and computation. Bayes’ theorem, specifically in the context of statistical inference, can be expressed as where \(D\) stands for observed or measured data, \(\theta\) stands for parameters, and \(f\) stands for some probability distribution. In the language of Bayesian inference, \(f(\theta \mid D)\) is the posterior distribution for the parameter \(\theta\), \(f(D \mid \theta)\) is the likelihood function that expresses the likelihood of having parameter \(\theta\) given some observed data \(D\), \(f(\theta)\) is the prior distribution for the parameter \(\theta\), and \(f(D)\) is evidence, the marginal probability of seeing the data, which is determined by summing or integrating across all possible values of the parameter, weighted by how strongly we believe in those particular values of \(\theta\). Concretely, Notice that this is not so different from the expansion of the denominator we saw with Bayes’ theorem, specifically equation (5).",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Then, cross entropy would have been calculated as Indeed, we can use our function to verify the coherency of this statement. In other words, when our predicted distribution equals the true distribution we are trying to model, cross entropy becomes 0, as a desirable cost function would behave. This is why crosss entropy is often used in classification models where we have a one-hot encoded vector that represents a true distribution, as exemplified by , and a prediction that models this distribution, denoted as  in our example. It is not difficult to see why cross entropy is a useful cost function frequently used in the field of machine learning. Entropy is an interesting concept with which we can quantify randomness in data. This process is no rocket science, but simply a process that involves calculations with probabilities. Although the link may not be immediately apparent, randomness is just another way of expressing probabilities and uncertainty, and it is from this premise that information and entropy take off. Beyond that, however, entropy is now used extensively in the field of machine learning, specifically as a loss function. Although it was not noted explicitly above, cross entropy calculates the same quantity as the logarithmic loss function. Essentially, cross entropy is useful in that it provides us with some intuitive information of how far two distributions are apart.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Notice that there is a 100-step cap, meaning if the drunkard was not able to find the restroom after a hundred steps, the trial was assumed a failure. We can verify the functionality of our design by calling the function. Cool! The Monte Carlo algorithm thus tells us that the probability of success is about 10 percent, which is a lot smaller thant I had personally anticipated. Think about how complicated it would have been to calculate this probability by hand. By simulating this game multiple times and counting the instances of successes, we can derive an estimation of the success rate of our particular random walk model. Let’s see what happens when we simulate the drunkard’s walk thirty times. In the particular instance that I have below, we see that the drunkard successfully reached the rest room four out of thirty attempts, which roughly equals the success probability of ten percent we saw earlier.  By now, hopefully you have been convinced that Monte Carlo is a wonderful method of solving problems. Although the examples we looked at were mostly simple, these algorithms can easily be applied to solve much harder ones. Simply put, Monte Carlo uses a brute force approach to simulate a particular instance of a model multiple times. Through such repeated sampling, we are able to gain a better understanding of the parameters underlying the issue at hand, no matter how complex. This is a pattern that we saw with all three tasks we dealt with in today’s post.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This is a highly intuitive restatement of the definition of conditional probability introduced above: given that event \(B\) has already occurred, conditional probability tells us the probability that event \(A\) occurs, which is then synonymous to that statement that \(A \cap B\) has occurred. By the same token, we can also define the reverse conditional probability of \(B\) given \(A\) through symmetry and substitution. Notice that the numerator stays unchanged since the operation of intersection is commutative. Now let’s develop an intuition for conditional probabilities by applying it to our example of clinical trials and the potentially affected patient. The purported accuracy of the clinical test is 90 percent, which we might express as follows, using the conditional probability notation: By the same token, we can also express the information on false positives as shown below. This conditional probability statement espouses that, given an individual who is not sick, the test returns a false positive 50 percent of the time. Conditional probability provides us with an interesting way to analyze given information. For instance, let \(R\) be the event that it rains tomorrow, and \(C\) be the event that it is cloudy at the present moment. Although we are no experts in climatology and weather forecast, common sense tells us that since with the additional piece of information that current weather conditions are cloudy, we are inclined to believe that it will likely rain tomorrow, or in the near future.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"For now, the simple observation that the performance seems to increase with more neurons, then fall at one point once overfitting starts to happen, will suffice to satisfy our curiosity. In this post, we built a neural network only using  and math. This was a lot more difficult than building other machine learning models from scratch particularly because of the heavy mathematics involved. However, it was definitely worth the challenge becasue completing and writing up this tutorial made me think a lot more about the clockwork of a neural network model. It is easy to think of neural networks as a black box, especially given the sheer ease of creating it. With just , one can build a simple neural network like this one in no time. Indeed, the main reason why I love the Keras functional API so much is that it is so easy to code and deploy a neural network model. However, when we write such models by depending on preexisting libraries, we sometimes grow oblivious to the intricacies the take place under the hood. It is my hope that reading and following along this post gave you a renewed sense of respect for the writers of such libraries, as well as the beauty of neural network models themselves.

"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","It’s time to put the methods we developed in the preceding sections to use for solving non-linear equations. Specifically, we’ll begin by taking look at a classic algorithm, the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is one of the many ways of solving non-linear equations. The intuition behind the Newton-Raphson method is pretty straightforward: we can use tangent lines to approximate the x-intercept, which is effectively the root of the equation . Specifically, we begin on some point on the graph, then obtain the tangent line on that point. Then, we obtain the -intercept of that tangent line, and repeat the process we’ve just completed by starting on a point on the graph whose -value is equal to that -intercept. The following image from Wikipedia illustrates this process quite well. (A digression: It’s interesting to see how “function” and “tangent” are written in German—in case you are wondering, I don’t know a word of German.)  Mathematically, the Newton-Raphson method can be expressed recursively as follows: Deriving this formula is quite simple. Say we start at a point on the graph, . The tangent line from that point will have a slope of . Therefore, the equation of the tangent line can be expressed as Then, the -intercept can simpy be obtained by finding an  value that which makes . Let  denote that point. Then, we arrive at the following update rule. Since we will be using  as the value for the next iteration, , and now we have the update rule as delineated in (4).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
VGG PyTorch Implementation,"Whenever we encounter , we would append a max pool layer to that stack. This is probably the longest code block I’ve written on this blog, but as you can see, the meat of the code lies in two methods,  and . These methods are where all the fun stacking and appending described above takes place. I actually added a little bit of customization to make this model a little more broadly applicable. First, I added batch normalization, which wasn’t in the original paper. Batch normalization is known to stabilize training and improve performance; it wasn’t in the original VGG paper because the batch norm technique hadn’t been introduced back when the paper was published. Also, the model above can actually handle rectangular images, not just square ones. Of course, there still is a constraint, which is that the  and  parameters must be multiples of 32. Let’s roll out the model architecture by taking a look at VGG19, which is the deepest architecture within the VGG family. If we print the model, we can see the deep structure of convolutions, batch norms, and max pool layers. We can clearly see the two submodules of the network: the convolutional portion and the fully connected portion. Now let’s see if all the dimensions and tensor sizes match up. This quick sanity check can be done by passing in a dummy input. This input represents a 3-channel 224-by-224 image. Passing in this dummy input and checking its shape, we can verify that forward propagation works as intended.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Word2vec from Scratch,"In a previous post, we discussed how we can use tf-idf vectorization to encode documents into vectors. While probing more into this topic and geting a taste of what NLP is like, I decided to take a jab at another closely related, classic topic in NLP: word2vec. word2vec is a technique introduced by Google engineers in 2013, popularized by statements such as “king - man + woman = queen.” The gist of it, as you may know, is that we can express words as vectors that encode their semantics in a meaningful way. When I was just getting starting to learn TensorFlow, I came across the embedding layer, which performed exactly this operation: transforming words into vectors. While I thought this process was extremely interesting, I didn’t know about the internals of this structure until today, particularly after reading this wonderful tutorial by Chris McCornick. In this post, we will be implementing word2vec, a popular embedding technique, from scratch with NumPy. Let’s get started! Instead of going over the concepts and implementations separately, let’s jump straight into the whole implementation process and elaborate on what is necessary along the way. In order to create word embeddings, we need some sort of data. Here is a text on machine learning from Wikipedia. I’ve removed some parentheses and citation brackets to make things slightly easier. Since we can’t feed raw string texts into our model, we will need to preprocess this text.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","The most common metric for error analysis is mean squared error, or MSE for short. MSE computes the magnitude of error as the squared distance between the actual value of data and that predicted by the regression line. We square the error simply to prevent positive and negative errors from canceling each other out. In the context of our regression problem, where \(f_\varepsilon\) denotes the error function. We can further break this expression down by taking note of the fact that the norm of a vector can be expressed as a product of the vector and its transpose, and that \(\hat{y} = A\hat{x}\) as established in the previous section of this post. Putting these together, Using distribution, we can simplify the above expression as follows: It’s time to take the gradient of the error function, the matrix calculus analogue of taking the derivative. Now is precisely the time when the propositions (4) and (5) we explored earlier will come in handy. In fact, observe that first term in (6) corresponds to case (5); the second term, case (4). The last term can be ignored because it is a scalar term composed of \(y\), which means that it will not impact the calculation of the gradient, much like how constants are eliminated during derivation in single-variable calculus. Now, all we have to do is to set the expression above to zero, just like we would do in single variable calculus with some optimization problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The Exponential Family,"First,  denotes a -dimensional random variable of interest; , a -dimensional parameter that defines the probability distribution.  is known as the sufficient statistic function. Below is a brief summary concerning the mappings of these different functions. You will notice that I used  and  instead of  and  as shown in equation (3). This is because (3) assumes vectorization of these functions as follows. We could have expressed (3) without vectorization, but doing so would be rather verbose. So we instead adhere to the vectorized convention in (3) throughout this post. As I hinted earlier, the exponential family covers a wide range of probability distributions, most PDFs and PMFs. In fact, most probability distributions that force themselves onto the page of statistics textbooks belong to this powerful family. Below is a non-comprehensive list of distributions that belong to the exponential family. Probability Density Functions Probability Mass Functions Of course, there are examples of common distributions that do not fall under this category, such as the uniform distribution or the student -distribution. This point notwithstanding, the sheer coverage of the exponential family makes it worthy of exploration and analysis. Also, notion of an exponential family itself is significant in that it allows us to frame problems in meaningful ways, such as through the notion of conjugate priors: if you haven’t noticed, the distributions outlined above all have conjugate priors that also belong to the exponential family.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","Notice that setting \(t = 1\) gives us the unit time version of the formula presented above. The link between the Poisson and Gamma distribution, then, is conveniently established by the fact that the time of the \(k\)th arrival is lesser than \(t\) if more than \(k\) events happen within the time interval \([0, t]\). This proposition can be expressed as an identity in the following form. Notice that the left-hand side is a cumulative distribution function of the Gamma distribution expressed in terms of \(t\). Given the derivative relationship between the CDF and PDF, we can obtain the probability distribution function of Gamma by deriving the right-hand side sigma expression with respect to \(t\). After some thinking, we can convince ourselves that unraveling the sigma results in a chain reaction wherein adjacent terms nicely cancel one another, ultimately collapsing into a single term, which also happens to be the first term of the expression: Recalling that \(\Gamma(k) = (k - 1)!\), we can rewrite the expression as follows: Notice the structural identity between the form we have derived and the equation of the Gamma distribution function introduced above, with parameters \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(k\).

Gaussian Process Regression,"The distance function of the squared exponential kernel looks as follows: We can apply distortions to the RBF function by adding things like coefficients, but for simplicity sake we omit them here. The key takeaway is that the RBF kernel function functions as a distance metric between two points. As an extreme example, let’s consider the case when , the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix, which is effectively the variance along those components. Then, Conversely, when  and  are extremely different points, We can thus deduce that the distance function returns a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the similarity or closeness between two points. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want for the covariance matrix. In short, the multivariate Gaussian that we will be using for GP regression can simply be summarized as where covariance  denotes the kernel matrix. In the RBF kernel function above, we were assuming a function without any noise, namely that . However, once we add in Gaussian noise as we saw above with  where , then we need to make adjustments to the kerne to account for added variations. With some thinking, we can persuade ourselves that the only modification that is needed pertains to the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix. This is because  only affects variance that exists within the univariate Gaussian for each point on the -axis without affecting the non-diagonal entries, which otherwise pertain to covariance between two points.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now it’s finally time to put our Nietzsche model to the test. How we will do this is pretty simple. First, we will feed a 60-character excerpt from the text to our model.

Then, we incorporate that one character prediction into the original 60-character data we started with. We slice the new augmented data set from  to end up with another prediction. We would then slice the data set from, you guessed it,  and repeat the process as outlined above. When we iterate through this cycle many times, we would eventually end up with some generated text.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"In a previous post, we took a look at autoencoders, a type of neural network that receives some data as input, encodes them into a latent representation, and decodes this information to restore the original input. Autoencoders are exciting in and of themselves, but things can get a lot more interesting if we apply a bit of twist. In this post, we will take a look at one of the many flavors of the autoencoder model, known as variational autoencoders, or VAE for short. Specifically, the model that we will build in this tutorial is a convolutional variational Autoencoder, since we will be using convolutional layers for better image processing. The model architecture introduced in this tutorial was heavily inspired by the one outlined in François Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python, as well as that from a separate article on the Keras blog. Let’s start by importing the modules necessary for this demonstration. The objective of today’s task is to build an autoencoder model that produces MNIST hand-written digits. The hidden dimension, or the latent space of the model, is going to a random vector living in two-dimensional space. Let’s specify this setup, along with some other miscellaneous configurations, before we proceed with constructing the model architecture. It’s time to build our model… or not quite now. Before we start stacking layers for the encoder and the decoder, we need to define a sampling function that will perform the meat of the variational inference involved in VAE.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"In other words, each integer corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary of the dataset. More specifically, the integer to which a word is mapped corresponds to the frequency with which the word appears, i.e. the word encoded as 10 corresponds to the 10th most frequent word in the data. We will apply some very basic preprocessing on the dataset so that we can feed it into our model. Specifically, we will preprocess the dataset such that only a  number of most frequently occurring words are considered. This step will weed out words that occur very infrequently, thus decreasing the amount of noise from the network’s perspective. Next, we will apply padding to the dataset so that all reviews are of length . This means that longer reviews will be truncated, whereas shorter reviews will be padded with zero entries. Below is a sample code implementation of this process. Let’s load the data using the  function after specifying necessary parameters. Now that the data is here and ready to go, it’s time to  build our neural network. To spice things up a bit, let’s create four different models and compare their performance. Before we jump into that, however, we first need to understand what an embedding layer is, as it is key to natural language processing. Simply put, an embedding layer is a layer that transforms words or integers that encode words into dense vectors.

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Based on prior knowledge, we would expect to find the local maximum at \(x = \mu\), as this is where the bell curve peaks. If we were to dig a bit deeper into prior knowledge, we would expect the point of inflection to be one standard deviations away from the mean, left and right. Let’s verify if these are actually true. From good old calculus, we know that we can obtain the local extrema by setting the first derivative to zero. We can ignore the constants as they are non-zero. Then, we end up with Because the exponent is always positive, the only way for the expression to evaluate to zero is if This tells us that the local maximum of the univariate Gaussian occurs at the mean of the distribution, as we expect. The inflection point can be obtained by setting the second order derivative of the probability distribution function equal to zero. Luckily, we’re already halfway done with calculating the second order derivative since we’ve already computed the first order derivative above. As we have done above, let’s ignore the constants since they don’t affect the calculation. Because the first exponential term cannot equal zero, we can simplify the equation to Therefore, From this, we can see that the inflection point of the univariate Gaussian is exactly one standard deviation away from the mean. This is one of the many interesting properties of the normal distribution that we can see from the formula for the probability distribution.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"The only difference here is that the integral takes continuous probability density functions into account, as opposed to discrete point probabilities we dealt with earlier. If we temporarily disregard the constants that show up in (6), we can conveniently trim down the equation for Bayesian inference as follows: This idea is not totally alien to us—indeed, this is precisely the insight we gleaned from the example of the potential patient. This statement is also highly intuitive as well. The posterior probability would be some mix of our initial belief, expressed as a prior, and the data newly presented, the likelihood. Bayesian inference, then, can be understood as a procedure for incorporating prior beliefs with evidence in order to derive an updated posterior. What makes Bayesian inference such a powerful technique is that the derived posterior can themselves be used as a prior for subsequent inference conducted with new data. To see Bayesian inference in action, let’s dive into the most classic, beaten-to-death yet nonetheless useful example in probability and statistics: the coin flip. This example was borrowed from the following post. Assume that we have a coin whose fairness is unknown. To be fair, most coins are approximately fair (no pun intended) given the physics of metallurgy and center of mass, but for now let’s assume that we are ignorant of coin’s fairness, or the lack thereof. By employing Bayesian inference, we can update our beliefs on the fairness of the coin as we accumulate more data through repeated coin flips.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"It is not difficult to see that the last few columns of \(U\) contain values so small that their contribution to data is going to be minimal at best. This is not the most mathematical way of presenting the concept of data—doing so would require us to take a look at other metrics such as covariance—but this basic analysis will suffice for our purposes for now. The takeaway is that dimensionality reduction is a meaningful way to extract important information from our data. Now that we have performed SVD on the ratings matrix, let’s move onto the last step: crafting a model for our recommendation algorithm. My personal pet theory is that using any word in conjunction with “algorithm” makes the concept sound more complex than it actually is. This is exactly what we are doing here, because in reality, our so-called algoithm for movie recommendations is going to be very simple. The intuition behind the recommendation system is distance calculation. Simply put, if users have similar movie preferences, the points representing the two users will appear to be close when plotted on a graph. Let’s see what this means by plotting  using . This can be achieved with the following code. We can pass  as an argument for the  function to see a three-dimensional plot of users’ movie preferences, as shown below.  Note that the points corresponding to User 6 and User 8 exactly overlap, which is why the points look darker despite being positioned near the corner of the plot.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","If we determine the values for the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the term \(\beta^\alpha/\Gamma(\alpha)\) reduces to some constant, say \(C\), allowing us to reduce the PDF into the following form: This simplified expression reveals the underlying structure behind the Gamma distribution: a fight for dominance between two terms, one that grows polynomially and the other that decays exponentially. Plotting the Gamma distribution for different values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) gives us a better idea of what this relationship entails. Executing this code block produces the following figure. Notice that, as \(\alpha\) increases, the Gamma distribution starts to look more like a normal distribution. At \(\alpha = 1\), the \(k^{a - 1}\) collapses to 1, resulting in an exponential distribution. A short tangential digression: the exponential distribution is a special case of a Gamma distribution that models the waiting time until the first event in a Poisson process. It can also be considered as the continuous version of the geometric distribution. But maybe more on this later on a separate post. Returning back to the Gamma distribution, we see that altering the \(\beta\) also produces a transformative effect on the shape of the Gamma PDF. Specifically, increasing \(\beta\) causes the distribution to move to the right along the \(x\)-axis. This movement occurs because, for every \(x\), a larger \(\beta\) value results in a decrease in the corresponding value of \(P(X = x)\), which graphically translates to a rightward movement along the axis as shown.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","Let’s first define \(A\) and \(x\) as follows: Then, We can now compute the gradient of this function according to (3): We have not provided an inductive proof as to how the same would apply to \(n\)-by-\(n\) matrices, but it should now be fairly clear that \(\nabla_x x^{T}Ax = 2Ax\), which is the single-variable calculus analogue of saying that \(\frac{d}{dx}k^2x = 2kx\). In short, \(\nabla_x b^{T}x = b \tag{4}\)
\(\nabla_x x^{T}Ax = 2Ax \tag{5}\) With these propositions in mind, we are now ready to jump back into the linear regression problem. At this point, it is perhaps necessary to remind ourselves of why we went down the matrix calculus route in the first place. The intuition behind this approach was that we can construct an expression for the total error given by the regression line, then derive that expression to find the values of the parameters that minimize the error function. Simply put, we will attempt to frame linear regression as a simple optimization problem. Let’s recall the problem setup from the linear algebra section above. The problem, as we framed it in linear algebra terms, went as follows: given some unsolvable system of equations \(Ax = y\), find the closest approximations of \(x\) and \(y\), each denoted as \(\hat{x}\) and \(\hat{y}\) respectively, such that the system is now solvable.

Introduction to tf-idf,"Although I’ve been able to automate some portion of the blog workflow, there’s always been a challenging part that I wanted to further automate myself using deep learning: automatic tagging and categorization. Every post requires some form of YAML front matter, containing information such as the title, tag, and category of the blog post to be uploaded. Although I sometimes create new tags or categories if existing ones seem unfit, I only deal with a limited number of topics on this blog, which is why I’ve always thought that some form of supervised learning be able to automate the process by at least generating some possible tags for me. I’m currently in the process of preparing the data (my previous blog posts) and building a simple NLP document classification model for the job. However, NLP is a field that I’m admittedly not well-acquainted with, not to mention the fact that I’ve not bee posting a lot about deep learning implementations for a while now. So in today’s short post, I decided to write about tf-idf vectorization, which is a very simple yet powerful technique that is often used in routine tasks like document classification, where SOTA models aren’t really required. As always, this post is going to take a hands-on approach by demonstrating a simple way of implementing tf-idf vectorization from scratch. Let’s get started. tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"In this post, we will revisit the topic of recurrent neural networks, or RNNs. Although we have used RNNs before in a previous post on character-based text prediction, we glossed over LSTM and assumed it as a black box that just worked. Today, we will take a detailed look at how LSTMs work by dissecting its components. Note that this post was inspired by this article by Kristiadi. I also heavily referenced this post by Christopher Olah. If you find any part of this article intriguing and intellectually captivating, you will surely enjoy reading their blogs as well. With this in mind, let’s jump right into it. Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, are one of the most widely used building blocks of Recurrent Neural Networks, or RNNs. This is because LSTMs overcame many of the limitations of basic vanilla RNNs: while simple RNN gates are bad at retaining long-term information and only remember input information that were fed into it relatively recently, LSTMs do a great job of retaining important information, even if they were fed into the cell long time ago. In other words, they are able to somewhat mimic the function of the brain, which involves both long and short-term memory. The structure of an LSTM cell might be summarized as follows: Note that  represents the Hadamard Product, which is nothing more than just the element-wise multiplication of matrices. This long list of equations surely looks like a lot, but each of them has a specific purpose. Let’s take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Namely, Because  is an approximation of , we naturally assume the same model for the approximate distribution: Now we can derive an expression for the negative KL divergence sitting in the ELBO expression: This may seem like a lot, but it’s really just plugging in the distributions into the definition of KL divergence as an expectation and using some convenient properties of logarithms to perform simple algebraic simplifications. To proceed further, observe that the first term is a constant that can escape out of the expectation: From the definition of variance and expectation, we know that Therefore, we can simplify (17) as follows: Let’s zoom in on the expected value term in (19). Our goal is to use (18) again so that we can flesh out another one half from that term. This can be achieved through some clever algebraic manipulation: But since the the expected value of  is constant and that of  is zero, We can now plug this simplified expression back into the calculation of KL divergence, in (19): Since we will standardize our input such that  and , we can plug these quantities into (22) and show that We are almost done with deriving the expression for ELBO.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"In the last post, we revisited the Riemann Zeta function, which we had briefly introduced in another previous post on Euler’s take on the famous Basel problem. It seems like math is my jam nowadays, so I decided to write another post on this topic—but this time, with some slightly different takes. In this post, we will explore an alternative way of solving the Basel problem using Fourier series expansion, and also discuss a alternative representations of the Basel problem in integral form. For the integral representations, I’m directly referencing Flammable Maths, a YouTube channel that I found both entertaining and informative. Let’s get started. First, let’s recall what the Basel problem is. The problem is quite simple: the goal is to obtain the value of an infinite series, namely This seems like an innocuous, straightforward problem. One can easily prove, for instance, the fact that this series converges using integral approximation. However, to obtain the value of this series is a lot more difficult than it appears—it is no coincidence that this problem remained unsolved for years until Euler came along. While there are many ways to solve this problem—Euler’s method, in particular, is one of the countless examples through which one can witness his amazing intuition and heuristic—but we will be using Fourier expansion to solve this problem, as it also provides a nice segue into the Dirichlet Eta function. We explored the topic of Fourier expansion in this previous post.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gaussian Process Regression,"Simply put, this means that we don’t have to consider things like the typical  in the context of linear regression. Normally, we would start off with something like This is sometimes also written in terms of a weight vector  or a function . Here, we also have some Gaussian noise, denoted by : However, since GPs are non-parametric, we do not have to specify anything about the model. How do we remove this consideration? The short answer is that we marginalize out the model from the integral. Let  denote the model,  the data,  the predictions. Normally, an integral like the one above would be intractable without a solution in closed form. Hence, we would have to rely on random sampling methods such as MCMC. However, in this case, we do have a closed form solution, and we know what it looks like: a Gaussian! This means that we uniquely identify the final posterior distribution through GP regression—all we need is the mean and covariance. Let’s start with the easy one first: the mean. The mean is a trivial parameter because we can always normalize the mean to zero by subtracting the mean from the data. Therefore, for simplicity purposes, we assume a zero mean throughout this post. The interesting part lies in the covariance. Recall that the covariance matrix is defined as follows: Roughly speaking, covariance tells us how correlated two entries of the random vector are.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"We all know from basic geometry that the value of \(\pi\) approximates to \(3.14\). There are obviously various ways to derive this value. Archimedes famously used hexagons to estimate that the value of \(\pi\) lies between \((\frac{22}{7}, \frac{223}{71})\). With later advances in math, mathematicians began to approach this problem from the angle of infinite series or products, the result of which were the Leibniz formula, Wallis product, Euler product, and the likes. And of course, modern computing now allows us to borrow the prowess of machinery to calculate this quantity with extreme accuracy. While the maths behind these derivations are fascinating, our approach will not take these routes; instead, we will use a crude Monte Carlo method. First, we draw a two-by-two square, inside of which we inscribe a circle of radius 1. For convenience purposes, let’s center this circle and square both at the origin. Next, we generate a series of random coordinates within the region of the square. Then, we count the percentage of dots that fall within the area of the cricle. Using a simple formula of proportions, we can calculate the area of the circle, through which we can then estimate the value of \(\pi\). Before we get into the specifics of this algorithm, let’s see hwo this plays out in code. Now that we have the function ready, let’s try calling it with some input parameters.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"This is also why we can only count seven points in total despite having plotted eight data points. In short, this visualization shows how we might be able to use distance calculation to give movie recommendations to a new user. Assume, for instance, that we get a new suscriber to our movie application. If we can plot  onto the space above, we will be able to see to whom User 10’s preference is most similar. This comparison is useful since User 10 will most likely like the movie that the other use also rated highly. We can also create a similar plot for movies instead of users. The plot is shown below:  With some alteration of the viewing angle, now we see through visualization that Movies 2 and 3 are close, as we had expected from the original ratings matrix . This is an interesting result, and it shows just how powerful singular value decomposition is at extracting important patterns from given data sets. Now that we understand what SVD does for us, it’s time to code our recommender function that uses distance calculation to output movie recommendations. In this post, we will be using the dot product as a means of determining distance, although other metrics such as Euclidean distance would suit our purposes as well. An advantage of using the dot product is that it is computationally less expensive and easy to achieve with code, as shown below.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Like this, conditional probability allows us to update our beliefs on uncertainty given new information, and we will see in the later sections that this is the core idea behind Bayesian inference. Let’s return back to the example of the potential patient with a flu. Shortly afterwards at the hospital, the the man was convinced by the doctor and decided to take the clinical test, the result of which was positive. We cannot assume that the man is sick, however, since the test has a rather high rate of false positives as we saw earlier. In this situation, the parameter that is of interest to us can be expressed as In other words, given a positive test result, what is the probability that the man is actually sick? However, we have no means as of yet to directly answer this question; the two pieces of information we have are that \(P(\text{test +} \mid \text{sick}) = 0.9\), and that \(P(\text{test +} \mid \text{¬sick}) = 0.5\). To calculate the value of \(P(\text{sick} \mid \text{test +})\), we need Bayes’s theorem to do its trick. Let’s quickly derive Bayes’ theorem using the definition of conditional probabilities delineated earlier. Recall that Multiply \(P(B)\) and \(P(A)\) on both sides of (1) and (2) respectively to obtain the following result: Notice that the two equations describe the same quantity, namely \(P(A \cap B)\). We can use equivalence to put these two equations together in the following form.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"This brings us to the next question: how many trials do we have? Here is where things get a bit more complicated—we don’t really have trials! Notice that this situation is somewhat distinct from coin tosses, as we do not have a clearly defined “trial” or an experiment. Nonetheless, we can approximate the distribution of this random variable by considering each ten-minute blocks as a unit for a single trial, i.e. if a call is received by the PMO between 22:00 and 22:10, then the trial is a success; if not, a failure. Blocking eight hours by ten minutes gives us a total of 48 trials. Because we assumed the average number of phone calls on a single shift to be 12, the probability of success \(p = 0.25\). Let’s simulate this experiment \(10000\) times. We can model this binomial distribution as follows: This code block produces the following output: Under this assumption, we can also calculate how lucky I was yesterday when I only received five calls by plugging in the appropriate values into the binomial PMF function: From a frequentist’s point of view, I would have lazy days like these only 7 times for every thousand days, which is nearly three years!

The Math Behind GANs,"This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence: The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function , we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words,  and  should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator  is thus one that which is able to mimic  to model a compelling model distribution . In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless. I hope you enjoyed reading this post.

Bayesian Linear Regression,"In today’s post, we will take a look at Bayesian linear regression. Both Bayes and linear regression should be familiar names, as we have dealt with these two topics on this blog before. The Bayesian linear regression method is a type of linear regression approach that borrows heavily from Bayesian principles. The biggest difference between what we might call the vanilla linear regression method and the Bayesian approach is that the latter provides a probability distribution instead of a point estimate. In other words, it allows us to reflect uncertainty in our estimate, which is an additional dimension of information that can be useful in many situations. By now, hopefully you are fully convinced that Bayesian linear regression is worthy of our intellectual exploration. Let’s take a deep dive into Bayesian linear regression, then see how it works out in code using the  library. In this section, we will derive the formula for Bayesian linear regression step-by-step. If you are feeling rusty on linear algebra or Bayesian analysis, I recommend that you go take a quick review of these concepts before proceeding. Note that I borrowed heavily from this video for reference. For any regression problem, we first need a data set. Let  denote this pre-provided data set, containing  entries where each entry contains an -dimensional vector and a corresponding scalar. Concretely, where The goal of Bayesian linear regression is to find the predictive posterior distribution for .

BLEU from scratch,"corresponds to ;  corresponds to . Using this modified metric, we can see that the  is now penalized quite a lot through the clipping mechanism. But there are still problems that modified precision doesn’t take into account. Consider the following example translation. To us, it’s pretty obvious that  is a bad translation. Although some of the key words might be there, the order in which they are arranged violates English syntax. This is the limitation of using unigrams for precision analysis. To make sure that sentences are coherent and read fluently, we now have to introduce the notion of n-grams, where  is larger than 1. This way, we can preserve some of the sequential encoding in reference sentences and make better comparison. The fact that unigrams are a poor way of evaluating translations becomes immediately clear once we plot the  in n-grams against modified precision.  As you can see, precision score decreases as  gets higher. This makes sense: a larger  simply means that the window of comparison is larger. Unless whole phrases co-occur in the translation and reference sentences—which is highly unlikely—precision will be low. People have generally found that a suitable  value lies somewhere around 1 and 4. As we will see later, packages like  use what is known as cumulative 4-gram BLEU score, or BLEU-4. The good news is that our current implementation is already able to account for different  values. This is because we wrote a handy little function, .

Dissecting LSTMs,"The equation for  is even simpler, since there is no matrix multiplication involved. Thus, the gradient flows backwards without any modification.

After all, isn’t that quantity precisely what we are trying to calculate? This is the one tricky yet also interesting part about RNN backpropagation. Recall that the whole point of a recurrent neural network is its use of variables from the previous forward pass. For example, we know that in the next forward pass,  will be concatenated with the input . In the backpropagation step corresponding to that forward pass, we would have computed ; thus, this gradient flows into the current backpropagation as well. Although this diagram applies to a standard RNN instead of an LSTM, the recurrent nature of backprop still stands. I present it here because I find this diagram to be very intuitive.  If you look at the right, the star represents the gradient from the last pass. If you look to the left, you will see that there is going to be a gradient for  that will eventually be passed over to the next backpropgation scheme.

Complex Fibonacci,"Okay, maybe I’m being too melodramatic about a graph, but there is no denying that this pattern is geometrically interesting and pleasing to the eye. Everything looks so intentional and deliberate. The comments on the aesthetics of the snail shell aside, one point that deserves our attention is what appears to be a straight line. Well, turns out that this is, in fact, not a straight line. The only reason why it appears straight is that the snail pattern overshadows the little vibrations on this portion of the graph. Indeed, zooming in, we see that there is an interesting damping motion going on. This is what the fibonacci sequence would have looked like had we plotted only the positive domain of the real number line.  In this post, we took a look at the fibonacci sequence and its interpolation across the real number line. We could go even crazier, as did Matt Parker in his own video, by attempting to interpolate the sequence on the complex number plane, at which point we would now have a mapping from two dimensions to two dimensions, effectively forcing us to think in terms of four dimensions. There is no fast, handy way of drawing or visualizing four dimensions, as we are creatures that are naturally accustomed to three dimensions.

In other words, We can also simplify the condition probability expression, since we already know that it follows a normal distribution. Therefore, we end up with And there we have it, the density function of the Gaussian mixture model! We have a convex combination of  different Gaussian PDFs that compose the Gaussian mixture model.

Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"Checking data types is necessary both for imputation and general data preprocessing. Specifically, we need to pay attention as to whether a given column encodes categorical or numerical variables. For example, we can’t use the mean to impute categorical variables; instead, something like the mode would make much more sense. The best way to determine whether a variable is categorical or not is simply to use domain knowledge and actually observe the data. Of course, one might use hacky methods like the one below: Although you might think that this is a working hack, this approach is in fact highly dangerous, even in this toy example. For example, consider , which is supposedly a numerical variable of type . However, earlier with , we saw that  is in fact a ordinal variable taking discrete values, one of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. So hacky methods must not be used in isolation; at the very least, they need to be complemented with some form of human input. Let’s try to use a simple pipeline to deal with missing values in some categorical variables. This is going to be our first sneak peak at how pipelines are declared and used. Here, we have declared a three-step pipeline: an imputer, one-hot encoder, and principal component analysis.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","However, this is obviously not the most systematic approach, and there is not even a clear guideline as to how they should go about pulling these levers. Here is where the Bayesian approach comes in handy. It isn’t difficult to frame this as a Bayesian problem. Given a pull of the slot machine, the result of which we will denote as , a Bernoulli random variable, we can then formulate the problem as follows: And as the classical Bayesian analysis goes, the more data we collect through repeated experiments, the closer the posterior distribution will get to the target distribution. Through this process, we are able to approximate the parameter . Now we have to think about what distributions we want to use for the prior and likelihood. Let’s start with the easier one: the likelihood. The natural choice that makes sense is the binomial distribution. Each pull on the lever can be considered a Bernoulli trial, and as we start exploring with more pulls to accumulate data, we will essentially be sampling from a binomial distribution, with  success and  failures out of a total of  trials. Therefore, more concretely, we can say The more interesting part is the prior distribution.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"In that context, a class label of 2 is not at all related to adding two data points belonging to class 1, or any arithmatic operation of that kind. To prevent our model from making such arbitrary, unhelpful connections, we convert class labels to one-hot encoded vectors. We could use external libraries such as  to invoke the  function, but instead let’s just build a function ourselves since this is a relatively simple task. Let’s test the  function on the training data. We don’t need the entire data to see that it works, so let’s slice the  array to see its first five elements. When we apply  to the data, we see that the returned result is a two-dimensional array containing one-hot encoded vectors, as intended. That’s all the data and the preprocessing we will need for now. Activation functions are important aspects of neural networks. In fact, it is what allows neural networks to model nonlinearities in data. As we will see in the next section, a neural network is essentially composed of layers and weights that can be expressed as matrix multiplications. No matter how complex a matrix may be, matrix multiplication is a linear operation, which means that is impossible to model nonlinearities.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"Welcome to part three of the “from scratch” series where we implement machine learning models from the ground up. The model we will implement today, called the naive Bayes classifier, is an interesting model that nicely builds on top of the Bayesian mindset we developed in the previous post on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Much like the logistic regression model, naive Bayes can be used to solve classification tasks, as opposed to regression in which case the goal is to predict a continuous variable. The main difference between logistic regression and naive Bayes is that naive Bayes is built on a probabilistic model instead of an optimization model such as graident descent. Hence, implementing naive Bayes is somewhat easier from a programming point of view. Enough of the prologue, let’s cut to the chase. To understand naive Bayes, we need not look further than Bayes’s theorem, which is probably the single most referenced theorem on this blog so far. I won’t explain this much since we have already seen it so many times, but presented below is the familar formula for reference and readability’s sake. Very standard, perhaps with the exception of some minor notation. Here,  refers to a single instance, represented as a vector with  entries; , the corresponding label or class for that instance.

Upon some more research, I also found an interesting paper that shows that there is a solid mathematical relationship between K-means clustering and PCA. I haven’t read the paper from top to bottom, but instead glossed over a summary of the paper on this thread on stack overflow.

As you can guess from the name of the variables, these two  parameters refer to the mean and log variance of the random vector living in our predefined latent space.

If any of this sounds foreign to you, I recommend that you read this post on the Gaussian distribution. Let’s continue our discussion with the sampling function. The goal here is to sample a random vector in the latent space from the distribution specified by the two parameters, mean and log variance. The sampling process can be expressed as follows: where  denotes the mean, corresponding to ,  denotes a tensor of random numbers sampled from the standard normal distribution, and  denotes the standard deviation (we will see how this is related to  in just a moment).

The Exponential Family,"Therefore, starting again from (19), we can continue our calculation of the gradient and set the quantity equal to zero to calculate the MLE estimate of the parameter.

To remove  abstractness, let’s employ a simple example, the exponential distribution, and attempt to derive a clearer understanding of the final picture. Recall that the probability density function of the exponential distribution takes the following form according to the factorizations outlined below: Computing the derivative of the log of the normalizing term  as we did in (22), Because we know that the resulting quantity is the expected value of the sufficient statistic, we know that And indeed, this is true: the expected value of the random variable characterized by an exponential distribution is simply the inverse of the parameter defining that distribution. Note that the parameter for the exponential distribution is most often denoted as , in which case the expected value of the distribution would simply be written as .

Now that we have successfully separated out the data by class, its’ time to write a function that will find the mean and standard deviation of each class data. This process is legitimate only because we assumed the data to be normally distributed—hence the name “Gaussian naive Bayes.” Let’s quickly see this in code. The  function receives a data set as input and returns a nested list that contains the mean and standard deviation of each column of the data set. For example, if we pass the toy data set  into , the returned list will contain two lists: the first list element corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of , and the second list element, . We can combine both  and  functions to create a new wrapper function  that returns the mean and standard deviation of each column for each class.

Because this is a Monte Carlo simulation, to have confidence in our estimate, we need to iterate the sampling process multiple times until we have sufficient amount of data. The  parameter determines the number of simulations we will perform. And much like in the previous  function, the  parameter determines the upper bound of our sampling range.

This is a good example. To get started, we might consider making a quick change of variables, namely . This will effectively get rid of the rather messy-looking denominator sitting in the fraction. To make further progress, at this point let’s consider the Taylor series expansion of . We can derive this by considering the following integral: since this integral evaluates to . One way to look at (10) would be to consider it as a sum of some geometric series whose first term begins with 1 and has a constant ratio of . In other words, Here is where a bit of complication comes in.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"The raw material that we pass into this filter is in fact the cell state, processed by a  activation function. This is also a familiar structure we saw earlier in the information update sequence of the network. Only this time, we use the cell state to generate output. This makes sense somewhat intuitively, since the cell state is essentially the memory of the network, and hence to generate output would require the use of this memory. Of course, this should not be construed so literally since what ultimately happens during backpropagation is entirely up to the network, and at that point we simply lay back and hope for the network to learn the best. This point notwithstanding, I find this admittedly coarse heuristic to be nonetheless useful in intuiting the clockwork behind LSTMs. At this point, we’re not quite done yet;  is not a vector of probabilities indicating which letter is the most likely in a one-hot encoded representation. Therefore, we will need to pass it through another affine layer, than apply a softmax activation. Hence,  is the final output of an LSTM layer. Here comes the tricky part: backprop. Thankfully, backprop is somewhat simple in the case of LSTMs due to the use of Hadamard products. The routine is not so much different from a vanilla neural network, so let’s try to hash out the equations. As we already know, backpropagation in neural networks is merely an extended application of the chain rule, with some minor caveats that matrix calculus entails.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Determining a probability distribution for the prior is a bit more challenging than coming up with the likelihood function, but we do have certain clues as to what characteristics our prior should look possess. First, the domain of the prior probability distribution should be contained within \([0, 1]\). This is because the range of the fairness parameter \(\theta\) is also defined within this range. This constraint immediately tells us that where \(f(x)\) is represents the probability density function that represents the prior. Recall that some of the other functions we have looked at, namely binomial, Poisson, Gamma, or exponential are all defined within the unclosed interval \([- \infty, \infty]\), making it unsuitable for our purposes. The Beta distribution nicely satisfies this criterion. The Beta distribution is somewhat similar to the Gamma distribution we analyzed earlier in that it is defined by two shape parameters, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Concretely, the probability density function of the Beta distribution goes as follows: The coefficient, expressed in terms of a fraction of Gamma functions, provides a definition for the Beta function. The derivation of the Beta distribution and its apparent relationship with the Gamma function deserves an entirely separate post devoted specifically to the said topic. For the purpose of this post, an intuitive understanding of this distribution and function will suffice. A salient feature of the Beta distribution that is domain is contained within \([0 ,1]\).",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Principal Component Analysis,"In general, the rule of thumb is that the gradient of a scalar with respect to a vector or a matrix should return a vector or matrix of the same dimension. Recall from (1) that reconstruction can be achieved by applying compression followed by a decoding operation: Since we know that  is just  and  is  by definition, we can express (1) in a different way. In retrospect, this is somewhat intuitive since  can roughly be thought of as a pseudo-orthonormal matrix—pseudo since there is no guarantee that it is a square matrix. Now, all that is left is to find the matrix . The way to go about this is to reconsider (3), the notion of minimizing data loss, given our findings in (6). In other words, Instead of considering a single observation, here we consider the design matrix in its entirety. Note that  is a design matrix whose rows correspond to a single observation. And because we are dealing with matrices, the Euclidean norm was replaced with its matrix equivalent, the Frobenius norm. Observe that the first term  can safely be removed from the argument since it is a constant with respect to ; let’s also change the argument of the minimum to the maximum given the negative sign. The Frobenius norm of a real matrix can be calculated as Therefore, The last equality is due to a useful property of trace, which is that we can cycle the order of matrices without changing its value.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"In short, document frequency tells us how frequently a given word appears throughout all documents; the inverse is the reciprocal of that quantity. In practice, we often apply a logarithm to prevent the idf score from exploding. Also, we add some smoothing to prevent division by zero. There seems to be many variations of how smoothing is implemented in practice, but here I present one way that seems to be adopted by scikit-learn. For other schemes, refer to this table on Wikipedia. However, this is a mere technically; the intuition we motivated earlier still applies regardless. With these ideas in mind, let’s go implement tf-idf vectorization in Python! In this section, we will develop a simple set of methods to convert a set of raw documents to tf-idf vectors, using a dummy dataset. Below are four documents (again, I know they’re short) that we will be using throughout this tutorial. The first step is to preprocess and tokenize the data. Although the specifics of preprocessing would probably differ from task to task, in this simple example, we simply remove all punctuations, change documents to lower case letters, and tokenize them by breaking down documents into a bag of words. Other possible techniques not discussed here include stemming and lemmatization. The  function accepts as input a set of documents and removes all the punctuation in each document. Here is the result of applying our function to the dummy data. Next, we need to tokenize the strings by splitting them into words.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Recently, I fortuitously came across an interesting blog post on the multi-armed bandit problem, or MAB for short. I say fortuitous because the contents of this blog nicely coincided with a post I had meant to write for a very long time: revisiting the Beta distribution, conjugate priors, and all that good stuff. I decided that the MAB would be a refreshing way to discuss this topic. “Bayesian” is a buzz word that statisticians and ML people love anyway, me shamelessly included. In this post, we will start off with a brief introduction into what the MAB problem is, why it is relevant, and how we can use some basic Bayesian analysis with Beta and Bernoulli distributions to derive a nice sampling algorithm, known as Thompson sampling. Let’s dive right into it. The multi-armed bandit problem is a classical gambling setup in which a gambler has the choice of pulling the lever of any one of  slot machines, or bandits. The probability of winning for each slot machine is fixed, but of course the gambler has no idea what these probabilities are. To ascertain out the values of these parameters, the gambler must learn through some trial and error. Given this setup, what is the optimal way of going about the problem? One obvious way is to start randomly pulling on some slot machines until they get a rough idea of what the success probabilities are.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
The Math Behind GANs,"Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible. In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is Generative Adversarial Nets by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin! GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each. To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post. The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"These days, machine learning and deep neural networks are exploding in importance. These fields are so popular that, unless you’re a cave man, you have probably heard it at least once. The exaggeration not withstanding, there is perhaps no necessity to justify the topic for today’s blog post: exploring a machine learning algorithm by building it from scratch. Apparently, “from scratch” is now a trendy pedagogical methodology employed in many websites and resources that claim to educate their readers about machine learning. To this, I agree: by constructing algorithms from the ground up, one can glean meaningful insights on how machine learning actually works, as opposed to viewing ML as some dark magic that suddenly makes computers intelligible beings. Enough of the prologue, let’s jump right in. As the name implies, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm works by findinng the nearest neighbors of some give data. Then, it looks at the labels of  neighboring points to produce a classification prediction. Here,  is a parameter that we can tweak to build the KNN model. For instance, let’s say we have a binary classification problem. If we set  to 10, the KNN modell will look for 10 nearest points to the data presented. If among the 10 neighbors observed, 8 of them have the label 0 and 2 of them are labeled 1, the KNN algorithm will conclude that the label of the provided data is most likely also going to be 0.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"Imagine one parent has  and the other has . Let’s also say that slicing a random portion of the first parent gave us . Then, we fill up the rest of the empty indices with the other parent, paying attention to the order in which elements occur. In this case, we would end up with . Let’s see how this works. Now, we wrap the swap and crossover mutation into one nice function to call so that we perform each mutation according to some specified threshold. Let’s test it on . When we call , we end up with the population bag for the next generation, as expected. Now it’s finally time to put it all together. For convenience, I’ve added some additional parameters such as  or , but for the most part, a lot of what is being done here should be familiar and straightforward. The gist of it is that we run a simulation of population selection and mutation over  generations. The key part is  and . Basically, we obtain the children from the mutation and pass it over as the population bag of the next generation in the  constructor. Now let’s test it on our TSP example over 20 generations.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Finally, here is the post that was promised ages ago: an introduction to Monte Carolo Markov Chains, or MCMC for short. It took a while for me to understand how MCMC models work, not to mention the task of representing and visualizing it via code. To add a bit more to the excuse, I did dabble in some other topics recently, such as machine learning models or information theory, which is also partially why this post was delayed quite a bit. Nevertheless, it’s finally here and ready to go. In this post, we will take a look at the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the simplest variant among the family of MCMC models. Let’s see what the Bayesian hype is all about. It’s been a while since we last discussed Bayesian inference, so it’s probably a good idea to start with a brief recap. Bayesian statistics commences from Bayes’ theorem, a seminal statement in probability theory that can be expressed as follows Alternatively, Bayes’ theorem can be stated more generally in the context of some partitioned sample space, For simplicity, I omit the equation for the case involving continuous random variables. Simply put, the summation experssion in the denominator would simply be replaced with that involving integration. The power of the proposition underlying Bayes’s theorem really comes into light when we consider it in the context of Bayesian analysis.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"For instance, a normal prior goes along with a normal likelihood; Gamma prior, Poisson likelihood; Gamma prior, normal likelihood, and so on. Our current combination, Beta prior and binomial likelihood, is also up on this list. To develop some intuition, here is a graphical representation of the Beta function for different values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). This code block produces the following diagram. Graphically speaking, the larger the value of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the more bell-shaped it becomes. Also notice that a larger \(\alpha\) corresponds to a rightward shift, i.e. a head-biased coin; a larger \(\beta\), a tail-oriented one. When \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) take the same value, the local extrema of the Beta distribution is established at \(\theta = 0.5\), when the coin is perfectly fair. Now that we have established the usability of the Beta function as a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function, let’s finally see Bayesian inference at work. Recall the simplified version of Bayes’ theorem for inference, given as follows: For the prior and the likelihood, we can now plug in the equations corresponding to each distribution to generate a new posterior. Notice that \(D\), which stands for data, is now given in the form \((k, n)\) where \(k\) denotes the number of heads; \(n\), the total number of coin flips. Notice also that constants, such as the combinatorial expression or the reciprocal of the Beta function, can be dropped since we are only establishing a proportional relationship between the left and right hand sides.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
BLEU from scratch,"Let’s see if the simple precision metric is able to capture this intuition. And indeed that seems to be the case! However, the simple precision-based metric has some huge problems. As an extreme example, consider the following  candidate translation. Obviously,  is a horrible translation, but the simple precision metric fails to flag it. This is because precision simply involves checking whether a hit occurs or not: it does not check for repeated bag of words. Hence, the original authors of BLEU introduces modified precision as a solution, which uses clipped counts. The gist of it is that, if some n-gram is repeated many times, we clip its count through the following formula: Here,  refers to the number of hits we assign to a certain n-gram. We sum this value over all distinct n-grams in the candidate sentence. Note that the distinction requirement effectively weeds out repetitive translations such as  we looked at earlier.  refers to the number of occurrences of a n-gram in the candidate sentence. For example, in , the unigram  appears 13 times, and so . This value, however, is clipped by , which is the maximum number of occurrence of that n-gram in any one of the reference sentences. In other words, for each reference, we count the number of occurrence of that n-gram and take the maximum value among them.

Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"To recap, from a very high level, Fourier expansion is a way of expressing some function in terms of trigonometric functions. If Taylor expansion used polynomials as the building block, Fourier expansion uses sines and cosines. A generic formula for the Fourier transform can be expressed as follows: With some integration, it can be shown that where  refers to the domain of integration. For instance, if we are integrating from  to , . A classic interval that is most commonly used is , and this is no coincidence: notice that, when , the Taylor series shown in (2) simplifies into the following: And indeed this is the format and the interval we will be using when constructing a Fourier series to tackle the Basel problem. To continue, we can derive a very similar expression for , given the specified interval from . Now that we have reviewed what Fourier series is and how we can construct it, let’s jump into the Basel problem. Just like the Taylor series, we can use Fourier expansion to represent any function continuous function. For our purposes, let’s try to expand a simple polynomial function, , using Fourier. We can begin with . Let’s continue with finding the even coefficients corresponding to the cosines. With some integration by parts, we can all agree that where the  terms appear because we end up plugging  into , a periodic function. And we can do the same for sine.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"But to really calculate how lucky I get for the next 18 months of my life in the military, we need to do a bit more: we need to also take into account the fact that receiving lesser than 5 calls on a shift also constitutes a lucky day. In other words, we need to calculate \(\sum_{n=0}^5 P(X = n)\), as shown below: This calculation can be done rather straightforwardly by plugging in numbers into the Poisson distribution function as demonstrated above. Of course, this is not the most elegant way to solve the problem. We could, for instance, tweak the Poisson distribution function and perform integration. The following is a code block that produces a visualization of what this integral would look like on a graph. Here is the figure produced by executing the code block above. You might notice from the code block that the integrand is not quite the Poisson distribution—instead of a factorial, we have an unfamiliar face, the  function. Why was this modification necessary? Recall that integrations can only be performed over smooth and continuous functions, hence the classic example of the absolute value as a non-integrable function. Factorials, unfortunately, also fall into this category of non-integrable functions, because the factorial operation is only defined for integers, not all real numbers. To remedy this deficiency of the factorial, we resort to the gamma function, which is essentially a continuous version of the factorial.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
PyTorch Tensor Basics,"If we apply  to , we essentially add a new dimension to the 0-th position of ’s shape.

There are in-place versions of both  and  though, and that is simply adding a  to the end of the function. For example, Equivalently, calling  will remove the th dimension of the tensor. By default,  is 0. Squeezing and unsqueezing can get handy when dealing with single images, or just single inputs in general. Concatenation and stacking are very commonly used in deep learning. Yet they are also operations that I often had trouble imagining in my head, largely because concatenation can happen along many axes or dimensions. In this section, let’s solidify our understanding of what concatenation really achieves with some dummy examples. With a basic example, we can quickly verify that each tensor is a three-dimensional tensor whose individual elements are two-dimensional tensors of shape . Now, let’s perform the first concatenation along the 0-th dimension, or the batch dimension.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","As you can see, the loss seems to be decreasing for the most part, although it is jumpy at times. Indeed, plotting  makes it clear that the loss has been decreasing, though not entirely in a steady, monotonous fashion.  In retrospect, we could have probably added a batch normalization layer to stabilize and expedite training. However, since this post is largely meant as an introduction to PyTorch modeling, not model optimization or design, the example suffices. Now we have finally reached the last step of the development cycle: testing and evaluating the model. This last step will also require us to write a custom loop as we receive batches of data from the  object we’ve created above. The good news, however, is that the testing loop is not going to look too much different from the training loop; the only difference will be that we will not be backpropagating per each iteration. We will also be using  to make sure that the model is in the evaluation mode, not its default training mode. This ensures that things like batch normalization and dropout work correctly. Let’s talk briefly about the details of this loop. Here, the metric we’re collecting is accuracy. First, we generally see how many correct predictions the model generates. Then, we also see per-class accuracy; that is, whether our model is good at predicting any particular class.

Gamma and Zeta,"This means that , using which we can establish the following: With some algebraic implications, we end up with Dividing both sides by , we get All the magic happens when we cast a summation on the entire expression: Notice that now we have the Riemann zeta function on the left hand side. All we have to do is to clean up what is on the right. As it stands, the integral is not particularly tractable; however, we can swap the integral and the summation expression to make progress. I still haven’t figured out the details of when this swapping is possible, which has to do with absolute divergence, but I will be blogging about it in the future once I have a solid grasp of it, as promised before. The expression in the parentheses is just a simple sum of geometric series, which we know how to calculate. Therefore, we obtain To make this integral look more nicer into a form known as the Bose integral, let’s multiply both the numerator and the denominator by . After some cosmetic simplifications, we end up with Putting everything together, now we have derived a nice expression that places both the Riemann zeta and the Gamma functions together: Or, alternatively, a definition of the Riemann zeta in terms of the Gamma: And indeed, with (13), we can evaluate the Riemann zeta function at non-integer points as well.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","We can pull these constants out of the integral to simplify the expression. These constants include the binomial and the reciprocal Beta normalizing constants. One useful observation to make here is the fact that the numerator itself looks a lot like something we have seen before: the Beta distribution. In fact, you might also realize that the denominator is nothing but just a normalizing constant that ensures that our posterior distribution, when integrated from 0 to 1, integrates up to 1 as the axiom of probability states. We can also see the denominator as the definition of the Beta function. In other words, Therefore, we end up with Notice that offers an extremely nice interpretation: the number of success  and failures , which are determined by , yield insight into what the true parameter is via the Beta distribution. This is why the Beta distribution is often referred to as a “probability distribution of probabilities.” I highly recommend that you read this post on cross validated for many intuitive explanations of what the Beta distribution is and how it can be useful, such as in this Bayesian context. Now we know that there is a closed-form solution for Bayesian problems involving conjugate priors and likelihood functions, such as a Beta prior coupled with the binomial likelihood.

Gaussian Mixture Models,"If we consider GMM to be a generative model, then we can imagine the generating process as follows: At this point, for clarity’s sake, let’s introduce some notations and concretize what has been elaborated above. First, we define a categorical distribution that will represent the mixing coefficients described above. Let  be an -dimensional vector that parametrizes this categorical distribution. In other words, This means that we assume the data to have  different clusters. Each  is then a mixing coefficient that establishes the convexness of the linear combinations of the underlying Gaussians. Now we can sample the cluster index, denoted as , from the categorical distribution as shown below. Note that we use  for the cluster index, since it is considered a latent variable—we don’t observe it directly, yet it is deeply involved in the data generation process. Quite simply, the probability that a data point belongs to the th cluster is represented by . The last step to data generation, as outlined in the bullet points above, is sampling a point from the corresponding Gaussian. where  and  are the mean and covariance matrices that parameterize the th Gaussian in the mixture model.

Likelihood and Probability,"“I think that’s very unlikely.” “No, you’re probably right.” These are just some of the many remarks we use in every day conversations to express our beliefs. Linguistically, words such as “probably” or “likely” serve to qualify the strength of our professed belief, that is, we express a degree of uncertainty involved with a given statement. In today’s post, I suggest that we scrutinize the concept of likelihood—what it is, how we calculate it, and most importantly, how different it is from probability. Although the vast majority of us tend to conflate likelihood and probability in daily conversations, mathematically speaking, these two are distinct concepts, though closely related. After concretizing this difference, we then move onto a discussion of maximum likelihood, which is a useful tool frequently employed in Bayesian statistics. Without further ado, let’s jump right in. As we have seen in an earlier post on Bayesian analysis, likelihood tells us—and pardon the circular definition here—how likely a certain parameter is given some data. In other words, the likelihood function answers the question: provided some list of observed or sampled data \(D\), what is the likelihood that our parameter of interest takes on a certain value \(\theta\)? One measurement we can use to answer this question is simply the probability density of the observed value of the random variable at that distribution.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"While genetic algorithms are not the most efficient or guaranteed method of solving TSP, I thought it was a fascinating approach nonetheless, so here goes the post on TSP and genetic algorithms. Before we dive into the solution, we need to first consider how we might represent this problem in code. Let’s take a look at the modules we will be using and the mode of representation we will adopt in approaching TSP. The original, popular TSP requires that the salesperson return to the original starting point destination as well. In other words, if the salesman starts at city A, he has to visit all the rest of the cities until returning back to city A. For the sake of simplicity, however, we don’t enforce this returning requirement in our modified version of TSP. Below are the modules we will be using for this post. We will be using , more specifically a lot of functions from  for things like sampling, choosing, or permuting.  arrays are also generally faster than using normal Python lists since they support vectorization, which will certainly be beneficial when building our model. For reproducibility, let’s set the random seed to 42. Now we need to consider the question of how we might represent TSP in code. Obviously, we will need some cities and some information on the distance between these cities.

Stirling Approximation,"Then,  will be a new Poisson random variable with mean .

The Central Limit Theorem then tells us that the distribution of the sum of these random variables will approximate a normal distribution. This concludes a rough proof of the Stirling approximation. For those of you who are feeling rusty on the Poisson distribution as I was, here is a simple explanation on the Poisson—specifically, its mean and variance. By the virtue of the definition of the parameter, it should be fairly clear why :  is a rate parameter that indicates how many events occur within a window of unit time.

Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"The implication of this decision is that the prior collapses to a constant.

This is an informative result that tells us that, at their core, MLE and MAP seek to perform the same operation. However, MAP, being a Bayesian approach, takes a specified prior into account, whereas the frequenting MLE simply seeks to dabble in data only, as probabilities are considered objective results of repeated infinite trials instead of subjective beliefs as a Bayesian statistician would purport.

Word2vec from Scratch,"What is the value that we are trying to approximate, and what sort of input will we be feeding into the model to generate predictions? The answer to these questions and how they tie into word2vec is at the heart of understanding word embeddings—as you may be able to tell, word2vec is not some sort of blackbox magic, but a result of careful training with input and output values, just like any other machine learning task. So here comes the crux of word2vec: we loop through each word (or token) in the sentence. In each loop, we look at words to the left and right of the input word, as shown below. This illustration was taken from this article by Ramzi Karam.  In the particular example as shown above, we would generate the following input and prediction pairs part of the training data. Note that the window size is two, which is why we look up to two words to the left and right of the input word. So in a way, we can understand this as forcing the model to understand a rough sense of context—the ability to see which words tend to stick together. In our own example, for instance, we would see a lot of , meaning that the model should be able to capture the close contextual affinity between these two words.

However, an important assumption behind eigendecomposition is that it can only be performed on nonsingular matrices.

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"Now that we have downloaded the data we need, let’s take a look at the data in more detail. First, here are the dependencies we will need. We first specify a directory, then try to print out all the labels there are. We can then construct a dictionary that maps a language to a numerical label. We see that there are a total of 18 languages. I wrapped each label as a tensor so that we can use them directly during training. Let’s store the number of languages in some variable so that we can use it later in our model declaration, specifically when we specify the size of the final output layer. Now, let’s preprocess the names. We first want to use  to standardize all names and remove any acute symbols or the likes. For example, Once we have a decoded string, we then need to convert it to a tensor so that the model can process it. This can first be done by constructing a  mapping, as shown below. We see that there are a total of 59 tokens in our character vocabulary. This includes spaces and punctuations, such as ` .,:;-‘(num_char, 59)(59,)`. We can now build a function that accomplishes this task, as shown below: If you read the code carefully, you’ll realize that the output tensor is of size , which is different from the explanation above. Well, the reason for that extra dimension is that we are using a batch size of 1 in this case.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The Math Behind GANs,"Therefore, we might consider the following to be the loss function of the discriminator: Here, we are using a very generic, unspecific notation for  to refer to some function that tells us the distance or the difference between the two functional parameters. (If this reminded you of something like cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, you are definitely on the right track.) We can go ahead and do the same for the generator. The goal of the generator is to confuse the discriminator as much as possible such that it mislabels generated images as being true. The key here is to remember that a loss function is something that we wish to minimize. In the case of the generator, it should strive to minimize the difference between 1, the label for true data, and the discriminator’s evaluation of the generated fake data. A common loss function that is used in binary classification problems is binary cross entropy. As a quick review, let’s remind ourselves of what the formula for cross entropy looks like: In classification tasks, the random variable is discrete. Hence, the expectation can be expressed as a summation. We can simplify this expression even further in the case of binary cross entropy, since there are only two labels: zero and one. This is the  function that we have been loosely using in the sections above.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Bayesian Linear Regression,"We might also notice that the sampled regression lines seem to stay below the true regression line for smaller values of . This is because we have more samples beneath the true regression line that we have above it. Bayesian linear regression is able to account for such variations in data and uncertainty, which is a huge advantage over the simple MLE linear regression method. The true power of Bayesian linear regression might be summarized as follows: instead of returning just a single line using the MLE weight estimate of data, Bayesian linear regression models the entire data set to create a distribution of linear functions so to speak, allowing us to sample from that distribution to obtain sample linear regression lines. This is an approach that makes much more sense, since it allows us to take into account the uncertainty in our linear regression estimate. The reason why the normal equation method is unable to capture this uncertainty is that—as you might recall from the derivation of the formula for vanilla linear regression—the tools we used did not involve any probabilistic modeling. Recall that we used only linear algebra and matrix calculus to derive the model for vanilla linear regression. Bayesian linear regression is more complicated in that it involves computations with probability density functions, but the end result is of course more rewarding. That’s it for today!

Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Recall that we were trying to derive the probability density function of the multivariate Gaussian by building on top of the formula for the univariate Gaussian distribution. We finished at then moved onto a discussion of variance and covariance. Now that we understand that the covariance matrix is the analogue of variance, we can substitute \(\sigma^2\) with \(\Sigma\), the covariate matrix. Instead of leaving \(\Sigma\) at the denominator, let’s use the fact that to rearrange the expression. This is another example of when the matrix-scalar parallel intuition can come in handy: the scalar multiplicative identity is 1, whereas the equivalent in matrix world is the identity matrix \(I\). Therefore, the reciprocal of a matrix can be interpreted as its inverse. From this observation, we can conclude that We are almost done, but not quite. Recall the the constant coefficient of the probability distribution originates from the fact that We have to make some adjustments to the constant coefficient since, in the context of the multivariate Gaussian, the integral translates into While it may not be apparent immediately, it is not hard to accept that the correcting coefficient in this case has to be as there are \(n\) layers of iterated integrals to evaluate for each \(x_1\) through \(x_n\).

The Exponential Family,"Much like in the previous post on maximum likelihood estimation, we begin with some data set of  independent and identically distributed observations. This is going to be the setup of the MLE problem. Given this dataset, the objective of maximum likelihood estimation is to identify some parameter  that maximizes the likelihood, i.e. the probability of observing these data points under a probability distribution defined by . In other words, How do we identify this parameter? Well, the go-to equipment in a mathematician’s arsenal for an optimization problem like this one is calculus. Recall that our goal is to maximize the likelihood function, which can be calculated as follows: The first equality stands due to the assumption that all data are independent and identically distributed. Maximizing (16) is a complicated task, especially because we are dealing with a large product. Products aren’t bad, but we typically prefer sums because they are easier to work with. A simple hack that we almost always use when dealing with maximum likelihood, therefore, is to apply a log transformation to calculate the log likelihood, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function. In other words, What does the log likelihood look like? Well, all we have to do is to apply a log function to (16), which yields the following result. Maximizing the log liklihood can be achieved by setting the gradient to zero, as the gods of calculus would tell us.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Continuing, the next subject of our interest would be \(\sigma\), as the variance is only strictly defined for one variable, as expressed by its definition below: where \(X\) is a random variable, which takes a scalar value. This necessarily begs the question: what is the multivariable equivalent of variance? To answer this question, we need to understand covariance and the covariance matrix. To jump right into the answer, the multivariable analogue of variance is covariance, which is defined as Notice that \(\text{Cov}(X, X)\) equals variance, which is why we stated earlier that covariance is the multivariate equivalent of variance for univariate quantities. The intuition we can develop from looking at the equation is that covariance measures how far our random variables are from the mean in the \(X\) and \(Y\) directions. More concretely, covariance is expresses the degree of association between two variables. Simply put, if there is a positive relationship between two variables, i.e. an increase in one variable results in a corresponding increase in the other, the variance will be positive; conversely, if an increase in one variable results in a decrease in the other, covariance will be negative. A covariance of zero signifies that there is no linear relationship between the two variables. At a glance, the concept of covariance bears strong resemblance to the notion of correlation, which also explains the relationship between two variables. Indeed, covariance and correlation are related: in fact, correlation is a function of covariance.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Invoking the  function returns the value of the estimation. The returned result is not abysmal, but we clearly can do a lot better. The reason behind this spotty estimation can be checked by drawing the plot of the Monte Carlo simulation, as shown below.  As we can see, ten samples simply aren’t enough to really cover the entire area of the plane or the circle. Although we do get some points in the circle, it’s really hard to tell if the proportion of points in and out of the circle is going to be representative of the actual proportion of area between the circle and the square. Let’s push our MC algorithm to do a bit more by sampling more data points, this time with 100000 randomly generated points. As expected, with more data points, we get a better estimation of pi. Although the randomness created by the  call in our function means that this estimation will fluctuate with each execution, the value is reliably close to the actual value of \(\pi\), differing only by about 0.01 or less. If we draw the plot for our experiment, it is clear that our data points accurately capture the proportionality between the area of the square and the circle.  We can systematically verify that more samples tend to yield better results by graphing the magnitude of the error of our estimation plotted against the number of random samples generated.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Based on our earlier mathematical analysis, we would expect this convergence to get even better as we expand out the  range, with an upper bound that is greater than the current 200.  While jumping around in Wikipedia, I came across the Dirichlet Eta function, which is a slight variant of the Riemann Zeta function. This function looks as follows: As you can see, this is essentially the alternating version of the Riemann Zeta function. Given this design, we can derive what may appear to be apparent to some yet nonetheless interesting relationship between the Eta and Zeta. Deriving this relationship requires a very similar operation to the sieving or factorizing we performed earlier to derive the probabilistic interpretation of the Zeta function. For a bit of intuition, observe that the Eta function can be split up into what may be referred to as even and odd terms. In other words, The idea is that the even terms are just a multiple of the Zeta function, namely Then, the odd terms can also be seen as the Zeta function minus this multiple: We now have successfully expressed both the even and odd terms of the Eta function in terms of the Zeta function. If we put the two together, we will then be able to express the entirety of the Eta function fully in terms of the Zeta function.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Let’s create a function to plot the performance of a neural network and the number of its neurons. Below is a  function that achieves this task. The function receives , , and  as arguments. The first two arguments specify the range for the number of neurons that we are interested in. For example, if we set them to 3 and 40, respectively, that means we want to see the accuracy of models with number of neurons ranging from 3 to 40 in a single layer. The  argument specifies the number of experiments we want to conduct. This way, we can calculate the mean accuracy, just as we did previously. Let’s call the function to create a plot.  The result shows that the performance of the neural network generally increases as the number of neurons increase. We don’t see signs of overfitting, but we know it happens: recall that our neural network model with 99 and 64 hidden neurons hit an accuracy of about 95 percent, whereas the model with only 30 to 40 neurons seem to be outperforming this metric by an accuracy hovering around 98 percent. After having realized this, I considered re-running the  function with a different range, but eventuially decided to stop the experiment  because running the  function took a lot more time than I had expected, even on Google Colab.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"And as we obtain larger quantities of data, the relative importance of the prior distribution starts to diminish. Imagine that we have an infinite number of data points. Then,  will soley be determined by the likelihood function, as the weight ascribed to the prior will decrease to zero. In other words, Conversely, we can imagine how having no data points at all would cause the weight values to shift in favor of the prior such that no importance is ascribed to the MLE estimate of the parameter. In this short article, we reviewed the concept of maximum a posteriori and developed a useful intuition about its result from the perspective of convex combinations. Maximum a posteriori, alongside its close relative maximum likelihood estimation,  is an interesting topic that deserives our attention. Hopefully through this post, you gained a better understanding of what the result of an MAP estimation actually means from a Bayesian point of view: a weighted average between the prior mean and the MLE estimate, where the weight is determined by the number of data points at our disposal. Also, I just thought that the name “convex conbinations” is pretty cool. The fancier the name, the more desire to learn—it is a natural human instinct indeed. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see if the function works as expected. Specifying  to 60 means that each instance in the training data will be 60 consecutive characters sampled from the text data every  characters. The result tells us that we have a total of 200278 training instances, which is probably plenty to train, test, and validate our model. The result also tells us that there are 57 unique characters in the text data. Note that these unique characters not only include alphabets but also and other miscellaneous white spacing characters and punctuations. Let’s now design our model. Because there is obviously going to be sequential, temporal structure underlying the training data, we will use an LSTM layer, a type of advanced recurrent neural network we saw in the previous post. In fact, this is all we need, unless we want to create a deep neural network spanning multiple layers. However, training such a model would cost a lot of time and computational resource. For the sake of simplicity, we will build a simple model with a single LSTM layer. The output layer is going to be a dense layer with  number of neurons, activated with a softmax function.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"Calculating this probability is simple: take the first case,  as an example. Assuming independence on each coin toss, we can use multiplication to calculate this probability: Notice that \(p = 1 - p = \frac12\) because we assumed the coin was fair. Had it not been fair, we would have different probabilities for \(p_{success}\) and \(p_{fail}\), explained by the relationship that \(p_{success} + p_{fail} = 1\). This is what the binomial PMF is implying: calculating the probability that we get \(k\) successes in \(n\) trials requires that we multiply the probability of success \(p\) by \(k\) times and the probability of failure \((1 - p)\) by \((n - k)\) times, because those are the numbers of successful and unsuccessful trials respectively. Now that we have reviewed the concept of binomial distribution, it is time to apply it to our example of phone calls at the Yongsan PMO. Although I do not have an  data sheet on me, let’s assume for the sake of convenience that, on average, 12 calls come to the PMO per shift, which is eight hours. Given this information, how can we simulate the situation as a binomial distribution? First, we have to define what constitutes a success in this situation. While there might be other ways to go about this agenda, the most straightforward approach would be to define a phone call as a success.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The objective of Bayesian statistical analysis is to update our beliefs about some probability, known as the posterior, given a preestablished belief, called the prior, and a series of data observations, which might be decomposed into likelihood and evidence. Concretely, This statement is equivalent to where  denotes the likelihood function. In plain language, Bayesian statistics operates on the assumption that all probabilities are reflections of subjective beliefs about the distribution of some random variable. A prior expectation or belief we might have about this distribution is referred to as the prior. Then, we can update our prior belief based on sample observations, resulting in a posterior distribution. Roughly speaking, the posterior can be considered as the “average” between the prior and the observed data. This process, which we went over in detail in this post, is at the heart of Bayesian inference, a powerful tool through which data and distributions can be understood. Theoretically, everything should work fine: given some prior and some sample observation data, we should be able to derive a posterior distribution for the random variable of interest. No big deal. Or so it seems. If we take a look again at equation (3), we will realize that there is an evidence term that we have to calculate sitting in the denominator.

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"For example,  does not reflect the fact that getting a 1 on a roll of the dice will move the player up to the thirty eighth cell; it supposes that the player would stay on the first cell.

Here is our final product: We can visualize the stochastic matrix \(T\) using the  package. This produces a visualization of our stochastic matrix. So there is our stochastic matrix! Now that we have a concrete matrix to work with, let’s start by identifying its eigenvectors. This step is key to understanding Markov processes since the eigenvector of the stochastic matrix whose eigenvalue is 1 is the stationary distribution vector, which describes the Markov chain in a state of equilibrium.

The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"At a glance, Euler’s identity is a confusing, mind-boggling mishmash of numbers that somehow miraculously package themselves into a neat, simple form: I remember staring at this identity in high school, trying to wrap my head around the seemingly discordant numbers floating around the equation. Today, I want to share some ideas I have learned since and demonstrate the magic that Euler’s identity can play for us. The classic proof for Euler’s identity flows from the famous Taylor series, a method of expressing any given function in terms of an infinite series of polynomials. I like to understand Taylor series as an approximation of a function through means of differentiation. Recall that a first-order derivative gives the slope of the tangent line at any given point of a function. The second-order derivative provides information regarding the convexity of the function. Through induction, we can convince ourselves that higher order derivatives will convey information about the curvature of the function throughout coordinate system, which is precisely the underlying mechanism behind Taylor’s series. In a more concise notation, we have Notice that \(x_0\) is the starting point of our approximation. Therefore, the Taylor series will provide the most accurate estimation of the original function around that point, and the farther we get away from \(x_0\), the worse the approximation will be. For the purpose of our analysis, let’s examine the Taylor polynomials for the following three functions: \(\sin(x), \cos(x)\), and \(e^x\). Recall that the derivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(\cos(x)\), which is precisely what the Taylor series suggests.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Demystifying Entropy (And More),"If you think about it for a second, this is a very intuitive definition of randomness: the more random and infrequent an event is, the more information would be required to represent it. With this in mind, now we move onto the bigger picture: entropy in the context of random variables. In the previous section, we looked at how random events can be represented as information in bits. What’s important here was that we were dealing with isolated random events instead of random variables. For example, in the fair coin toss example, we dealt with information involved with  and , not the binomial random variable  itself. This is an important distinction to make, because entropy is essentially a probabilistically weighted average of all the random events that a random variable can take. In other words, entropy is defined as the weighted average of information given by each random event: For the continuous case, we would use an integral instead. Say  denotes the random variable of interest in a fair coin toss. Then, we are most interested in how much bits, on average, we would need to encode information generated from the distribution of this random variable. Using (3), we can easily answer this question by calculating the follows: This tells us that the entropy involved in a fair coin toss is 1 bit, i.e, on average, we only need a single digit of binary number to encode information given by a fair coin toss.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","We started by looking at the Poisson probability mass function, and started our venture into the Gamma function by pondering the question of interpolating the factorial function.

This may all sound very abstract because of the theoretical nature of our discussion. So in the posts to follow, we will explore how these distributions can be applied in different contexts. Specifically, we will take a look at Bayesian statistics and inference to demonstrate how distributions can be employed to express prior or posterior probabilities. At the same time, we will also continue our exploration of the distribution world by diving deeper into other probability distributions, such as but not limited to exponential, chi-square, normal, and beta distributions, in no specific order.

Gaussian Process Regression,"Here, we modify (9) to have an added parameter, , which is a multiplicative constant to the exponent.

In theory, the final function sampled through GP is considered an infinite dimensional vector, but for practical reasons of implementation, the vector in this case will be at most 60 dimensions: ten training points and 50 test points, appended together as one vector. Next, let’s build the kernel with the test points and draw random samples to see what our prior looks like. Recall that sampling can be easily achieved by performing the Cholesky decomposition on the kernel. Let’s plot the ten random samples drawn from the prior. Note that at this point, we have not seen any training data at all. The only stricture imposed on GP vis a vis the kernel is the fact that the function must be smooth, i.e. points that are close to each other in must be highly correlated.

The Gibbs Sampler,"The full result is available on Wikipedia, but it’s always more interesting and rewarding to derive these results ourselves. But in this section, we will assume that we already know the final result of the derivation and use the formula for now. Note that the two functions are symmetrical, which is expected given that this is a bivariate distribution. These functions simulate a conditional distribution, where given a value of one random variable, we can sample the value of the other. This is the core mechanism by which we will be sampling from the joint probability distribution using the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Let’s initialize the parameters for the distribution and test the sampler. Great! This works as expected. For the purposes of demonstrating the implications of burn-in, let’s define discard the first 100 values that were sampled. Below is the plot of the final resulting distribution based on sampled values using the Gibbs sampler. The result is what we would expect: a bivariate Gaussian.  And this is what we end up with if we sample directly from the bivariate Gaussian instead of using the Gibbs sampler. Note that we can do this only because we chose a deliberately simple example; in many other contexts, this would certainly not be the case (if we could sample from a distribution directly, why use the Gibbs sampler in the first place?).

During the backward pass, we compute the gradient. Here, we need to retrieve the  variable which was stored in the context. This is because the ReLU function takes the following form: Thus, its derivative is During backpropagation, this means that gradients will flow down to the next layer only for those indices whose input elements to te ReLU function were greater than 0. Thus, we need the input vector for reference purposes, and this is done via stashing it in the  variable. We will see how we can incorporate  into the model in the next section. In this example, we’ll take a look at an extremely simple model to gain a better understanding of how everything comes into play in a more practical example.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"As expected, we see that the result is normal, a result due to the property of conjugacy. Another observation we might make is that the posterior mean is seems to be slightly larger than 0. This is an expected result given that the mean of the numbers in our toy data set was larger than 0. Because the posterior can be intuited as an “average” between the observed data set and the prior, we would expect the posterior to be centered around a value greater than zero, which is indeed the case.

Let’s go back to equation (7), which is the crux of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. To recap, the MCMC sampler works by assuming some value sampled from the proposal distribution, calculating the likelihood and posterior, and seeing if the new proposed value is worth accepting, i.e. if it is worth making a jump in the random walk.

In reality, most samples are not equiprobable; some values are more likely than others, unless in the context of uniform distributions. To account for this, let’s reframe (7) as an expected values calculation, i.e. give different weight to each likelihood ratio depending on the probability of observing that data point. Let’s make (8) look better by unpacking the fraction sitting in the log function as a subtraction of two terms. The final key is to realize the secret that In other words, we have derived the mathematical definition of KL divergence!

Revisiting Basel with Fourier,"Or, even better, with the key insight that  is an even function, we might intelligently deduce that there will be no sine terms at all, since sine functions are by nature odd.

Therefore, putting everything together, we end up with If we consider the case when , we have Do you smell the basel problem in the air? The summation on the right hand side is a great sign that we are almost done in our derivation. Moving the fractional term to the left hand side, we get: Diding both sides by 4, And there you have it, the answer to the Basel problem, solved using Fourier series! We can also derive a convergence value of the Dirichelt Eta function from this Fourier series as well. Recall that the Eta function looks as follows: Now how can we get a Dirichelt Eta function out of the fourier series of ? Well, let’s get back to (8) and think our way through. One noteworthy observation is that we already have  in the summation, which looks awfully similar to the Dirichlet Eta function.

Understanding the  Leibniz Rule,"Before I begin, I must say that this video by Brian Storey at Olin College is the most intuitive explanation of the Leibniz rule I have seen so far. Granted, my greedy search over the internet space was by no means exhaustive, so I’ve probably missed some other hidden gems  here and there. Also, the video is intended as a visual explanation for beginners rather than a robust analytical proof of the Leibniz rule. This point notwithstanding, I highly recommend that you check out the video. This post is going to provide a short, condensed summary of the proof presented in the video, minus the fancy visualization that pen and paper can afford. The Leibniz rule, sometimes referred to as Feynman’s rule or differentiation-under-the-integral-sign-rule, is an interesting, highly useful way of computing complicated integrals. A simple version of the Leibniz rule might be stated as follows: As you can see, what this rule essentially tells us is that integrals and derivatives are interchangeable under mild conditions. We’ve used this rule many times in a previous post on Fisher’s information matrix when computing expected values that involved derivatives. Why is this the case? It turns out that the Leibniz rule can be proved by using the definition of derivatives and some Taylor expansion. Recall that the definition of a derivative can be written as This is something that we’d see straight out of a calculus textbook.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"This can be seen by simply interpreting the posterior from a conditional probability point of view: the posterior denotes the probability of the value of the model parameter is  given data . Put differently, the value of  that maximizes the posterior is the optimal parameter value that best explains the sample observations. This is why at its heart, MAP is not so much different from MLE: although MLE is frequentist while MAP is Bayesian, the underlying objective of the two methods are fundamentally identical. And indeed, this similarity can also be seen through math. And we see that (5) is almost identical to (3), the formula for MLE! The only part where (5) differs is the inclusion of an additional term in the end, the log prior. What does this difference intuitively mean? Simply put, if we specify a prior distribution for the model parameter, the likelihood is no longer just determined by the likelihood of each data point, but also weighted by the specified prior. Consider the prior as an additional “constraint”, construed in a loose sense. The optimal parameter not only has to conform to the given data, but also not deviate too much from the established prior. To get a more intuitive hold of the role that a Bayesian prior plays in MAP, let’s assume the simplest, most uninformative prior we can consider: the uniform distribution. A uniform prior conveys zero beliefs about the distribution of the parameter, i.e. all values of  are equally probable.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Normally, defining a loss function is very easy: in most cases, we  use pre-made loss functions that are available through the TensorFlow API, such as cross entropy or mean squared error. In the case of variational autoencoders, however, this is not such an easy task: how do we judge the robustness or the effectiveness of the decoder, which is essentially a generative algorithm? Of course, we could stop training once the figures it generates becomes reasonable, i.e. the mock MNIST digits it creates looks compelling to the human eye. However, this is a subjective metric at best, and we can’t expect there to be a ML engineer peering at the screen, looking at the outputs of the decoder per each epoch. To tackle this challenge, we need to dive into some math. Let’s take a look. First, let’s carefully review what our goal is for this task. The motivating idea behind variational autoencoders is that we want to model a specific distribution, namely the distribution of the latent space given some input. As you recall, this latent space is a two dimensional vector modeled as a multivariate diagonal Gaussian. Using Bayes’ theorem, we can express this distribution as follows: By now, it is pretty clear what the problem its: the evidence sitting in the denominator is intractable. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate or derive  in its closed form; hence the need for variational inference. The best we can do is to find a distribution  that best approximates .",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"In fact, we can borrow the same notation we used for linear regression to frame logistic regression as follows: In other words, logistic regression can be understood as a process in which our goal is to find the weight coefficients in the equation above the best describe the given data set. Unlike in linear regression, where the predicted value is computed simply by passing the data as arguments into a linear function, logistic regression outputs numbers between 0 and 1, making binary classification possible. However, there is certainly an element of linearity involved, which is part of the reason why both linear and logistic regression models fall under a larger family of models called generalized linear models. Now that we know the basic maths behind logistic regression using the sigmoid function, it’s time to implement it via code. Welcome to the next part of the tutorial, where we start building the actual model from scratch. As always, it’s a good idea to have some dummy data ready for disposal so that we can develop some basic intuition about dimensionality of our data when handling inputs and outputs of our functions.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"05, 0.1, and 0.5. Just like before, we cap the number of iterations to 200 epochs.  The graph shows that the larger the learning rate, the quicker the decrease in cross entropy loss. This result is coherent with what the previous visualizations on accuracy suggested: the higher the learning rate, the quicker the model learns from the training data. In this post, we built the logistic regression model from scratch by deriving an equation for gradient descent on cross entropy given a sigmoid function. In the process, we brought together many useful concepts we explored on this blog previously, such as matrix calculus, cross entropy, and more. It’s always exciting to see when seemingly unrelated concepts come together to form beautiful pictures in unexpected ways, and that is what motivates me to continue my journey down this road. The logistic regression model is simple yet incredibly powerful in the context of binary classification. As we saw earlier with the application of the model to the task of bank notes authentication, the logistic regression model can, when tweaked with the appropriate parameters, make surprisingly accurate predictions given sufficient amount of training data. Of course, the processing of training and tweaking is not always easy because we have to determine some hyperparameters, most notably the learning rate of the gradient descent algorithm, but the fact that logistic regression is a robust model is unchanged nonetheless.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"We know for a fact that where  and  denote the events that the coin lands on heads and tails, respectively. How might we be able to express information involved in the event that the coin lands on tails? How about heads? There are many ways to approach this problem, but an easy way would be to use binary numbers. For example, we might ascribe meaning to 0 and 1 such that 0 represents heads and 1 represents tails. Of course, there might be other ways to encode information, such as setting 111 to heads and 000 to tails, but obviously this is wasting information. In other words, it is not the most efficient method of encoding. Even under a single digit binary number scheme, we would be able to decode a series of transmitted information without loss. It is not difficult to see, therefore, that all we need to express the result of a fair coin toss is a single digit of binary numbers 0 and 1. Typically, we use bits to denote the number of digits required to express information in binary numbers. In this case, the information involved in  is equal to 1 bit; by symmetry, the same goes for .

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"For each walk, function will generate a random number to determine the direrction of his movement. The magnitude of each walk is 1 by default. Beforer a walk is performed, we will invoke another function to check if his movements are legal, i.e. whether he stepped out of the boundary of the pub. If his moves are legal, we continue with the movement; if not, we stop and assume that the trial has yielded a failure. The goal of this random walk is to end up in the top-right portion of the pub, a square defined by coordinates \((8, 8), (8, 10), (10, 8)\), and \((10, 10)\). Now that we have established the basics of this game, let’s start coding away. Our little random walk simulator is now ready to go! Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see if the code works as expected. We see that the returned tuple contains the flag boolean value as well as a list containing the coordinates of the first ten steps the drunkard took in this experiment, which is exactly what we expected. Now it is time to put this Monte Carlo application to the test by simulating the walk many times and counting the instances of successes verses failures.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the Bayesian way of thinking was eschewed for so long by statisticians: prior to the advent of calculators and computers, mathematicians had trouble deriving the closed-form expression for the evidence term with just pen and paper. We might consider options other than direct calculation, such as Monte Carlo approximation or deriving a proportionality experssion by assuming evidence to be a constant. Indeed, the latter is the approach we took in this post on Bayesian inference. Using a beta prior and binomial likelihood, we used the property of conjugacy to derive a formula for the posterior. However, this raises yet another question: what if the prior and likelihood do not have a conjugate relationship? What if we have a very messy prior or complicated likelihood function, so convoluted to the point that calculating the posterior is near impossible? Simple Monte Carlo approximation might not do because of a problem called the curse of dimensionality: the volume of the sample space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. In high dimensions, the brute force Monte Carlo approach may not be the most appropriate. Markov Chain Monte Carlo seeks to solve this conundrum of posterior derivation in high dimensions sample space. And indeed, it does a pretty good job of solving it. How does Markov Chain Monte Carlo get around the problem outlined above? To see this, we need to understand the two components that comprise Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Markov chains and Monte Carlo methods.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"When we only have a few data points, the more probability there is that we obtain skewed data, which is why the mean estimate of our posterior seems skewed as well. However, with a larger number of trials, the law of large numbers guarantees that we will eventually be able to identify the value of our parameter \(\theta\), which is indeed the case. The key takeaway from this code block is the line . This is all the Bayesian method there is in this updating procedure. Notice that this line of code directly corresponds to the formula for the updated Beta posterior distribution we found earlier, which is \(k\) refers to , \(n\) corresponds to , and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are set to  in order to take into account the initial prior which tends to a uniform distribution. An interesting observation we can make about this result is that the variance of the Beta posterior decreases with more trials, i.e. the narrower the distribution gets. This is directly reflective of the fact that we grow increasingly confident about our estimate of the parameter with more tosses of the coin. At the end of the 500th trial, we can conclude that the coin is fair indeed, which is expected given that we simulated the coin flip using the command . If we were to alter the argument for this method, say , then we would expect the final result of the update to reflect the coin’s bias.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"Concretely, this statement might be translated as We can separate the variables to achieve the following expression: Integrating both sides yields Let’s get rid of the logarithm by exponentiating both sides. That’s an ugly exponent. But we can make things look better by observing that the constant term \(C\) can be brought down as a coefficient, since where we make the substitution \(A = e^C\). Now, the task is to figure out what the constants \(A\) and \(k\) are. There is one constraint equation that we have not used yet: the integral of a probability distribution function must converge to 1. In other words, Now we run into a problem. Obviously we cannot calculate this integral as it is. Instead, we need to make a clever substitution. Here’s a suggestion: how about we get rid of the complicated exponential through the substitution Then, it follows that Therefore, the integral in (1) now collapses into Now that looks marginally better. But we have a very dirty constant coefficient at the front. Our natural instinct when we see such a square root expression is to square it. What’s nice about squaring in this case is that the value of the expression is going to stay unchanged at 1. Because the two integrals are independent, i.e. calculating one does not impact the other, we can use two different variables for each integral.

Hopefully the visualization gave you a better understanding of what our model looks like. Now that we have a function that creates our model, we are ready to run the model! At this point, our neural network model is only a dictionary that contains matrices of specified sizes, each containing randomly genereated numbers. You might be wondering how a dictionary can be considered a model—after all, a dictionary is merely a data structure, and so is incapable of performing any operations. To make our model to work, therefore, we need a function that performs matrix multiplications and applies activation functions based on the dictionary. The  function is precisely such a function that uses the weights stored in our model to return both the intermediary and final outputs, denoted as  and  respectively.

Complex Fibonacci,"It is worth noting that the quantity in the parenthesis, namely is otherwise referred to as the Golden ratio. Also observe that the other quantity is the negative inverse of the Golden ratio. Let’s take a closer look at why the Binet’s formula makes sense. This is not going to be a rigorous proof or a derivation, but rather an attempt at cursory analysis to provide food for thought. This process was heavily referenced from this Quora post. Intuitively, Binet’s formula has to do with the well-known fact that the ratio between two consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden ratio as  goes to infinity. In this light, we might understand the fibonacci sequence as a geometric sequence with a constant ratio. The goal, then, is to show that the ratio is in fact the Golden ratio. Then, we have the following recurrence relation between consecutive terms. Dividing both sides by , we get This is a simple quadratic equation that we can easily solve. With some precalculus algebra, we get And indeed we start to see the Golden ratio and its negative inverse as solutions to the quadratic.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Although I’m no science major, one of the few things that I recall from high school chemistry class is the Gibbs free energy equation for calculating the spontaneity of reactions, which went as follows: where the term for entropy, denoted as  satisfies the condition that We won’t get into the details of these equations, but an intuition that we can glean from this equation is that the randomness of a particle is determined by the number of potential states that are possible for that given particle. In other words, a gas particle that freely moves across space at ATP is going to be more random than a near-static water particle composing an ice cub. We might take a step further and say that the gas particle carries a larger amount of information than the particle in a solid since more information is required to express its randomness. Entropy in science, denoted above as , provides us with a valuable intuition on the topic of randomness and information. In fact, it is no coincidence that the notion of randomness in information theory, a subfield of math that we are going to be dipping our toes in, borrowed the term “entropy” to express randomness exhibited in data.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The underlying idea is that, given some data with  feature columns, we can derive a probability distribution for the label for that intance. The naive assumption that the naive Bayes classifier makes—now you can guess where that name comes from—is that each of the  variables in the instance vector are independent of one another. In other words, knowing a value for one of the features does not provide us with any information about the values for the other  feature columns. Combining this assumption of independence with Bayes’ theorem, we can now restate (1) as follows: Pretty straight forward. We know that the demominator, which often goes by the name “evidence” in Bayesian inference, is merely a normalizing factor to ensure that the posterior distribution integrates to 1. So we can discard this piece of information and distill (2) down even farther: Equation (3) tells us that it is possible to calculate the probability of instance  belonging to class  systematically. Why is this important? The simple answer is that we can use (3) to train the naive Bayes classifier. Say we know that for a particular instance , the label is . Then, we have to find the distribution for each feature such that we can maximize . Does this ring any bells? Yes—it is maximum a posteriori estimation!

We can only use the Gibbs sampler in a restricted context: namely, that we have access to conditional probability distributions. You quickly see why the Gibbs sampler can only be used in limited contexts. Nonetheless, when these set of information are available, it is a powerful algorithm with which we can sample from intractable distributions. Let’s see how this works. The gist of the Gibbs sampler is simple: sample from known conditional distributions, and use that resulting value to sample the next random variable from the following conditional probability distribution, ad infinitum. But this is just a lot of words and some needless Latin for fun and flair, so let’s hash out what the sentence really means. Continuing on from our generic example, let’s say we sampled a value from the first conditional probability distribution. We will use a superscript and subscript notation to each denote the iteration and the sequence of random variable. Assume that we start from some random -dimensional vector to start with.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"Because this function has to perform more tasks than the functions we wrote earlier, the example code is slightly longer, but here it goes: Basically, the  function counts the number of labels of each class and stores the results in a dictionary.

Likelihood and Probability,"But first, let’s clarify the fact that \(P(D \mid \theta)\) is probability density, not probability. Moreover, the interpretation of probability density in the context of likelihood is different from that which arises when we discuss probability; likelihood attempts to explain the fit of observed data by altering the distribution parameter. Probability, in contrast, primarily deals with the question of how probable the observed data is given some parameter \(\theta\). Likelihood and probability, therefore, seem to ask similar questions, but in fact they approach the same phenomenon from opposite angles, one with a focus on the parameter and the other on data. Let’s develop more intuition by analyzing the difference between likelihood and probability from a graphical standpoint. To get started, recall the that This is the good old definition of probability as defined for a continuous random varriable \(X\), given some probability density function \(f(p)\) with parameter \(\theta\). Graphically speaking, we can consider probability as the area or volume under the probability density function, which may be a curve, plane, or a hyperplane depending on the dimensionality of our context. Unlike probability, likelihood is best understood as a point estimate on the PDF. Imagine having two disparate distributions with distinct parameters. Likelihood is an estimate we can use to see which of these two distributions better explain the data we have in our hands. Intuitively, the closer the mean of the distribution is to the observed data point, the more likely the parameters for the distribution would be.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Let’s say we want to estimate the value of an integral of a function \(f\) over some domain \(D\).

Notice that this integral can now be understood as an expected value for some continuous random variable. In other words, \(F\) collapses into the following expression. What does this tell us? This means that we can simply calculate an integral by randomly sampling the values of \(f(x)\) such that \(x\) follows some probability distribution \(p(x)\). The probability distribution part simply ensures that values of \(x\) that are more probable are sampled more often than others. Intuitively, we are effectively taking a weighted mean of the values of \(f(x)\), which is the loose definition of expected values. Now, to simplify things a bit, we are going to take a look at an example that does not involve much probability distributions. Conside the following integal of sine, a classic in calculus 101: The reason why we chose this integral is that we know how to calculate it by hand. Therefore, we can match the accuracy of our crude Monte Carlo against an actual, known value. Let’s fist quickly compute this integral. Now time for Monte Carlo.

Noting the fact that there are several constants in this expression, we can simplify this into To minimize this expression, we set its gradient equal to zero. Note that we are deriving with respect to . Therefore, We are finally done with our derivation. This equation tells us that the direction of steepest descent is defined by the inverse of the Fisher matrix multiplied by the gradient of the loss function, up to some constant scaling factor. This is different from the vanilla batch gradient descent we are familiar with, which was simply defined as Although the difference seems very minor—after all, all that was changed was the addition of Fisher’s matrix—yet the underlying concept, as we have seen in the derivation, is entirely different. This was definitely a math-heavy post. Even after having written this entire post, I’m still not certain if I have understood the details and subtleties involved in the derivation. And even the details that I understand now will become confusing and ambiguous later when I return back to it.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Principal Component Analysis,"How do we go about searching for multiple eigenvectors? This can be done, once again, with Lagrangians, with the added caveat that we will have more trailing terms in the end. Let’s elaborate on this point further. Here, we assume that we have already obtained the first component, , and our goal is to find the next component, . With induction, we can easily see how this analysis would apply to finding . Simply put, the goal is to maximize  under the constraint that  is orthogonal to  while also satisfying the constraint that it is a unit vector. (In reality, the orthogonality constraint is automatically satisfied since the covariance matrix is symmetric, but we demonstrate this nonetheless.) Therefore, Using Lagrangians, In the last equality, we make a trivial substitution to simplify and get rid of the constant. We also use the fact that the covariance matrix is symmetric. If we left multiply (18) by , But since , the first two terms go to zero. Also, the last term reduces to  since . This necessarily means that . If we plug this result back into (18), we end up with the definition of the eigenvector again, but this time for . Essentially, we iterate this process to find a specified number of principal components, which amounts to finding   number of eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. A while back, we discussed both eigendecomposition as well as singular value decomposition, both of which are useful ways of decomposing matrices into discrete factors.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Note that a lot of the code in this post was largely inspired by Peter’s blog. Before we get into any modeling, let’s first import the modules we’ll need and set things up. Instead of using the approach outlined in the blog I’ve linked to, I decided to use objects to model bandits. The rationale is that this approach seems to make a little bit more intuitive sense to me. Also, working with Django these days has made me feel more affinity with Python classes. At any rate, let’s go ahead. Now, we can initialize a bandit with some predetermined parameter, . Of course, our goal would be to determine the true value of this parameter through sampling and Bayesian magic. In this case, we have created a fair bandit with a  of 0.5. We can also simulate level pulls by repeatedly calling on . Note that this will accumulate the result of each Bernoulli trial in the  list object. Notice that we also have . This is an a list object that c Now that we have performed all the basic sanity checks we need, let’s quickly go ahead and create three bandit objects for demonstration purposes. Now we get into the details of how to perform the Bayesian update.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Also, User 6 and User 8 have identical prefernece for movies—perhaps they both like a particular genre, or tend to like the movie starred by some actor or actress. We would expect singular value decomposition to capture these observations in some way, albeit approximately. Now, let’s actually perform singular value decomposition on the ratings matrix. We could try to do this manually by hand, but let’s utilize the power of modern computing to save ourselves of the time and mental effort involved in calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a ten-by-ten matrix. Luckily for us, the  module contains some excellent functionality to help us with singular value decomposition. Using this library, singular value decomposition can very simply be achieved with just a few lines of code. The parameters of the  function are , the ratings matrix, and , the number of non-trivial entries of \(\Lambda\) to select for dimensionality reduction, as we have seen earlier. More technically speaking,  corresponds to the number of “concepts” or dimensions that we will extract from the matrix. Let’s see what this means by actually running this function. Great! This is what dimensionality reduction means in the loosest sense. Instead of having 5 entries each row, as we had with the original ratings matrix , we now have 3 entries per row. In other words, the information on users has been compressed into three dimensions.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Instead of using hand-made dummy data as I had done in some previous posts, I decided to use the  library to generate random data points. This approach makes a lot more sense given that neural networks require a lot more input data than do machine learning models. In this particular instance, we will use the  function to accomplish this task. Let’s take a look at what our data looks like. As expected, the dataset contains the  and  coordinates of the points generated by the  function. If you haven’t heard about this function before, you might be wondering what all the moons deal is about. Well, if we plot the data points, it will become a lot more obvious.  As you can see, the generated points belong to either one of two classes, and together, each class of points seem to form some sort of moon-like shape. Our goal will be to build a neural network that is capable of determining whether a given point belongs to class 0 or class 1. In other words, this is a classic example of a binary classification problem. It is standard practice in any classification problem to convert class labels into one-hot encodeded vectors. The reason why this preprocessing is necessary is that the class number is merely a label that does not carry any meaning.

A Simple Autocomplete Model,"Now, all we have to do is to train the model with the data. Let’s run this for 50 epochs, just to give our model enough time to explore the loss function and settle on a good minimum. As I was training this model on Google Colab, I noticed that training even this simple model took a lot of time. Therefore, I decided that it is a good idea to probably save the trained model—in the worst case scenario that poor network connection suddenly caused the Jupyter kernel to die, saving a saved model file would be of huge help since I can continue training again from there. Saving the model on Google Colab requires us to import a simple module, . The process is very simple. To load the model, we can simply call the command below. Let’s take a look at the loss curve of the model. We can simply look at the value of the loss function as printed throughout the training scheme, but why not visualize it if we can?  As expected, the loss decreases throughout each epoch. The reason I was not paticularly worried about overfitting was that we had so much data to work with, especially in comparison with the relatively constrained memory capacity of our one-layered model. One of the objectives of this tutorial was to demonstrate the fun we can have with generative models, namely neural networks that can be used to generate data themselves, not just classify or predict data points.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"After something like 30 iterations, it seems like algorithm has converged to the minimum, sitting at around 86.25. Apparently, the best way to travel the cities is to go in the order of . But this was more of a contrived example. We want to see if this algorithm can scale. So let’s write some functions to generate city coordinates and corresponding adjacency matrices.  generates  number of random city coordinates in the form of a numpy array. Now, we need some functions that will create an adjacency matrix based on the city coordinates. Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see if  works as expected. Here, give vertices of a unit square as input to the function. While we’re at it, let’s also make sure that  indeed does create city coordinates as expected. Now, we’re finally ready to use these functions to randomly generate city coordinates and use the genetic algorithm to find the optimal path using  with the appropriate parameters. Let’s run the algorithm for a few iterations and plot its history.  We can see that the genetic algorithm does seems to be optimizing the path as we expect, since the distance metric seems to be decreasing throughout the iteration. Now, let’s actually try plotting the path along with the corresponding city coordinates. Here’s a helper function to print the optimal path. And calling this function, we obtain the following:  At a glance, it’s really difficult to see if this is indeed the optimal path, especially because the city coordinates were generated at random.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"This is why VAEs are considered to be generative models: if we feed the VAE some two-dimensional vector living in the latent space, it will spit out a digit. Whether or not that digit appears convincing depends on the random vector the decoder was provided as input: if the vector is close to the learned mean, , then the result will be convincing; if not, we might see a confusing blob of black and white. Let’s see what exactly is going on in the fuzzy region of the image, because that is apparently where all the digits mingle together and seem indistinguishable from one another. Put differently, if we vary the random vector little by little across that region, we will be able to see how the digit slowly morphs into another number.  How cool is that? We were able to get a VAE to show us how one digit can shift across a certain domain of the latent space. This is one of the many cool things we can do with a generative model like a variational autoencoder. In this post, we took a deep dive into the math behind variational autoencoders. It was a long journey, but definitely worth it because it exposed us to many core concepts in deep learning and statistics.

Fisher Score and Information,"Therefore, given some dataset, often times we use the empirical Fisher as a drop-in substitute for Fisher’s information. The empirical Fisher is defined quite simply as follows: In other words, it is simply an unweighted average of the covariance of the score function for each observed data point. Although this is a subtlety, it helps to clarify nonetheless. Something that may not be immediately apparent yet nonetheless true and very important about Fisher’s information is the fact that it is the negative expected value of the second derivative of the log likelihood. In our multivariate context where  is a vector, the second derivative is effectively the Hessian. In other words, You might be wondering how the information matrix can be defined in two says, the covariance and the Hessian. Indeed, this threw me off quite a bit as well, and I struggled to find and understand a good resource that explained why this was the case. Thankfully, Mark Reid’s blog and an MIT lecture contained some very helpful pointers that got me a long way. The derivation is not the easiest, but I’ll try to provide a concise version based on my admittedly limited understanding of this topic. Let’s start from some trivially obvious statements. First, from the definition of a PDF and the derivative operation, we know that Therefore, both the first and second derivative of this function are going to be zero.

"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Having a uniform prior only makes sense on the very first try, when there is no historical data to estimate the parameter from. However, once we start pulling the lever and seeing the results of each consecutive pull, we should be able to build some prior expectation as to what the true value of the parameter is. This suggests that the uniform prior approach is missing some important key pieces. To really drive this point home, let’s discuss more about the notion of conjugate priors, specifically in the context of the Beta and binomial distributions. The notion of conjugate priors is something that recurs extremely often in Bayesian analysis. This is mainly because conjugate priors offer a nice closed-form solution to posterior distribution computation. Simply put, a conjugate prior to some likelihood function is a type of prior that, when multiplied with a given likelihood, produces a posterior distribution that is of the same form as itself. For example, a Beta prior, when multiplied with a binomial likelihood, produces a Beta posterior. This is what we want in Bayesian analysis, since we can now assume that posterior to be our new prior in the next iteration of experiments. In this section, we will build on top of this high level understanding of conjugacy to show that a Beta distribution is indeed a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood function. On that end, let’s start with a quick definition review of the Beta distribution and the Beta function.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"I say almost, because we still have not dealt with the trailing term in (13): At this point, it is extremely useful to recall the definition of cross entropy, which is generically defined as follows: Therefore, we see that the trailing term in (13) is just a cross entropy between two distributions! This was a circumlocutions journey, but that is enough math we will need for this tutorial. It’s time to get back to coding. All that math was for this simple code snippet shown below: As you can see, this short code snippet shows, in essence, how we can define a compile a model with a custom loss function. In this case,  refers to the reconstruction loss, which is the cross entropy term we saw earlier. , as you might expect, simply refers to KL divergence. Notice how there is a  multiplying factor in the  expression, just like we did when we derived it in the section above. With some keen observations and comparisons, you will easily see that the code is merely a transcription of (13), with some minor differences given dimensionality. One important fact to note is that the gradient descent algorithm, by default, seeks to minimize the loss function. However, we discussed above how the objective of VAE is to maximize ELBO. Therefore, we modify ELBO into a loss function that is to be minimized by defining the loss function as the negative of ELBO.

The Exponential Family,"Although this is by no means a rigorous proof, we see not only the evident fact that the exponential distribution indeed belongs to the exponential family, but also that the factorization formula in (3) isn’t just a complete soup of equations and variables. We can do the same for the Bernoulli distribution, which also falls under the exponential family. The formula for the Bernoulli distribution goes as follows: Again, I have added a very simple indicator function to ensure that the the probability mass function is well-defined across the entire real number line. Again, the indicator function is a simple boolean gate function that checks whether  is an element within a set of zero and one: Factorizing the Bernoulli is slightly more difficult than doing the same for the exponential distribution, largely because it is not apparent from (9) how factorization can be achieved. For example, we do not see any exponential term embedded in (9) as we did in the case of the exponential distributions. Therefore, a simple one-to-one correspondence cannot be identified. The trick to get around this problem is to introduce a log transformation, then reapplying an exponential. In other words, By applying this manipulation, we can artificially create an exponential term to more easily coerce (9) into the factorization mold.

Note that the loader returns a tuple of images and labels, which we can unpack directly within the  loop itself.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"Because we were dealing with a very simple example of biased coins, entropy values we calculated did not go past 1 bits, but we can easily imagine situations were it might, such as a dice roll or more complicated real-life examples. In this light, entropy is one metric with which we can quantify randomness, which is the mission we set out to accomplish in this post. But entropy is a lot more than just an interesting concept on randomness. Entropy has wide ranging applications, especially in the field of machine learning and neural networks. Among these, we will be looking at cross entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, two derivative concepts of entropy that are arguably most commonly used. Let’s start with the big picture first—when these concepts are used, what is the relationship between the two, why they are important—and move onto the details later. First, we have to know that cross entropy, unlike just entropy, deals with two probability distributions instead of one. Specifically, cross entropy is a way of measuring the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. In a typical scenario, we might have a true probability distribution  that we are trying to model, and our deep learning algorithm might produce some approximate probability distribution . We might evaluate the effectiveness of our model by calculating the distance between  and . Seen in this light, cross entropy can be interpreted as a target cost function to be minimized.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"However, we can get a bit more scientific by calculating the cross entropy to see exactly how well our model performed with the given data.

On a trivial note, we prevent Python from running into math domain errors, we add  to the provided distribution if the list contains 0. The result is unsurprising. If we recall that the definition of entropy is the amount of information content needed to encode information, we will quickly realize that  is a distribution with probability 1, which is why it makes sense that entropy converges to 0. Therefore, in this case, KL divergence equals cross entropy, which computes to approximately 0.415. What actually happened beneath the hood? If we recall the definition of cross entropy, we can easily see that, among the 10 terms, 9 of them were eliminated since  given the setup of the distribution .

As simple as it appears, there are so many different techniques and modes of analysis we can use to approach the problem. It was nice exercise and review of some calculus techniques. I’ve been digging more into the curious interchange of integral and summation recently, and when this operation is allowed, if at all.

The Exponential Family,"This was the hard part: now, all that is left is to configure the rest of the functions to complete the factorization. One possible answer is presented below: By now, it should be sufficienty clear that the definition of the exponential family is robust enough to encompass at least the two probability distributions: the exponential and the Bernoulli. Although we do not go over other examples in this article, the exponential family is a well-defined set of probability distributions that, at thei core, are defined by a common structure. And as we will see in the next section, this underlying similarity makes certain calculations surprisingly convenient. In a previous post, we explorerd the notion of maximum likelihood estimation, and contrasted it with maximum a posteriori estimation. The fundamental question that maximum likelihood estimation seems to answer is: given some data, what parameter of a distribution best explains that observation? This is an interesting question that merits exploration in and of itself, but the discussion becomes a lot more interesting and pertinent in the context of the exponential family. Before diving into MLE, let’s define what is known as the canonical form of the exponential family.

BLEU from scratch,"I decided to use anonymous functions for the sake of simplicity and code readability. Next, let’s write a function that creates n-grams from a given sentence.

In the context of machine translations, we can consider positives as roughly corresponding to the notion of hits or matches. In other words, the positives are the bag of word n-grams we can construct from a given candidate translation. True positives are n-grams that appear in both the candidate and some reference translation; false positives are those that only appear in the candidate translation. Let’s use this intuition to build a simple precision-based metric. First, we need to create some n-grams from the candidate translation. Then, we iterate through the n-grams to see if they exist in any of the n-grams generated from reference translations. We count the total number of such hits, or true positives, and divide that quantity by the total number of n-grams produced from the candidate translation.

Likelihood and Probability,"From this, it follows that Rearranging this equation, we are able to obtain the final expression for the optimal parameter \(\mu\) that which maximizes the likelihood function: As part 2 of the trilogy, we can also do the same for the other parameter of interest in the normal distribution, namely the standard deviation denoted by \(\sigma\). We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by \(\sigma^3\). After a little bit of rearranging, we end up with Finally, we have obtained the parameter values for the mean and variance of a normal distribution that maximizes the likelihood of our data. Notice that, in the context of normal distributions, the ML parameters are simply the mean and standard deviation of the given data point, which closely aligns with our intuition: the normal distribution that best explains given data would have the sample mean and variance as its parameters, which is exactly what our result suggests. Beyond the specific context of normal distributions, however, MLE is generally very useful when trying to reconstruct or approximate the population distribution using observed data. Let’s wrap this up by performing a quick verification of our formula for maximum likelihood estimation for normal distributions.

All there is left, then, is to figure out what term frequency and inverse document frequency are. Without much explanation, you can probably guess what term frequency is: it simply indicates how frequently a word appeared in a given document. For example, if there were a total of 3 distinct words in a document (very short, I know), then each of the three words would have a tf score of . Put differently, the sum of the tf vector for each document should sum to one. The definition of a tf score might be thus expressed as where the denominator denotes the count of all occurrences of the term  in document , and the numerator represents the total number of terms in the document. Roughly speaking, inverse document frequency is simply the reciprocal of document frequency. Therefore, it suffices to show what document frequency is, since idf would immediately follow from df.

Fisher Score and Information,"Using the Leibniz rule we saw earlier, we can interchange the derivative and come up with the following expressions. Granted, these expressions somewhat muffle the shape of the quantity we are dealing with, namely vectors and matrices, but it is concise and intuitive enough for our purposes. With these statements in mind, let’s now begin the derivation by first taking a look at the Hessian of the score function. From the chain rule, we know that This does not look good at all. However, let’s not fall into despair, since our goal is not to calculate the second derivative or the Hessian itself, but rather its negative expected value. In calculating the expected value, we will be using integrals, which is where the seemingly trivial statements we established earlier come in handy. By linearity of expectation, we can split this expectation up into two pieces. Let’s use integrals to express the first expectation. The good news is that now we see terms canceling out each other. Moreover, from the Leibniz rule and the interchanging of the integral and the derivative, we have shown that the integral in fact evaluates to zero. This ultimately leaves us with Therefore we have established that And we’re done! In this post, we took a look at Fisher’s score and the information matrix.

This may appear to be a lot of computation, but all we’ve done is just separating out the integrals while paying attention to the domains of integration. Let’s continue by doing the same for the remaining terms. The first two terms in the limit go away since  goes to zero. While the same applies to the fractional terms, one difference is that they are also divided by , which is why they remain. We have simplified quite a bit, but we still have two terms in the limit expression that we’d like to remove.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"This code block produces the following output: The first entry of this array, which is the value , deserves our attention, as it is the eigenvalue which corresponds to the stationary distribution eigenvector. Since the index of this value is , we can identify its eigenvector as follows: Notice that this eigenvector is a representation of a situation in which the player is in the \(100\)th cell of the game board! In other words, it is telling us that once the user reaches the \(100\)th cell, they will stay on that cell even after more dice rolls—hence the stationary distribution. On one hand, this information is impractical given that a player who reaches the end goal will not continue the game to go beyond the \(100\)th cell. On the other hand, it is interesting to see that the eigenvector reveals information about the structure of the Markov chain in this example. Markov chains like these are referred to as absorbing Markov chains because the stationary equilibrium always involves a non-escapable state that “absorbs” all other states. One might visualize this system as having a loop on a network graph, where it is impossible to move onto a different state because of the circular nature of the edge on the node of the absorbing state. At this point, let’s remind ourselves of the end goal. Since we have successfully built a stochastic matrix, all we have to do is to set some initial starting vector \(x_0\) and perform iterative matrix calculations.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"It might be some genre, actress, or any hidden patterns in the data set that we are not aware of. Regardless, what’s important here is that we can now understand data more easily in smaller dimensions. An impotant observation to make is that, as we have noted earlier, User 6 and User 8 have rows that are identical. While this should not be a surprise given that the two users had what seemed to be an identical taste in movies, it is still interesting to see how SVD is able to extract this information and display it onto a new axis. Next, let’s see what  looks like. Shown above is the transpose of , which means that  is just really \({V^T}^T = V\). What’s important here is that the five movies have also been reduced to three dimensions. We don’t really know what the columns of this matrix means; all we know is that it is some distillation and amalgamation of information about the ten users on some unknown axis. At any rate, the previous ten dimensional vectors have now been reduced to three dimensions, which is great news for us—as three dimensional beings, it’s always easier to visualize and deal with three dimensions or less than 10D.

The Math Behind GANs,"Through a partial derivative of  with respect to , we see that the optimal discriminator, denoted as , occurs when Rearranging (12), we get And this is the condition for the optimal discriminator! Note that the formula makes intuitive sense: if some sample  is highly genuine, we would expect  to be close to one and  to be converge to zero, in which case the optimal discriminator would assign 1 to that sample. On the other hand, for a generated sample , we expect the optimal discriminator to assign a label of zero, since  should be close to zero. To train the generator, we assume the discriminator to be fixed and proceed with the analysis of the value function. Let’s first plug in the result we found above, namely (12), into the value function to see what turns out. To proceed from here, we need a little bit of inspiration. Little clever tricks like these are always a joy to look at. If you are confused, don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. Basically, what is happening is that we are exploiting the properties of logarithms to pull out a  that previously did not exist. In pulling out this number, we inevitably apply changes to the terms in the expectation, specifically by dividing the denominator by two. Why was this necessary? The magic here is that we can now interpret the expectations as Kullback-Leibler divergence: And it is here that we reencounter the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is defined as where .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Complex Fibonacci,"Then, in the next call of , the program recalculates the same values calculated earlier, up until the th fibonacci number, just one short of the previous one. The classic way to deal with this problem is to use a technique known as memoization. The idea is simple: we keep some sort of memo or cache of values that have already been calculated and store them in some data structure that we don’t have to recalculate values that have already been computed prior. Here is a simple implementation. To see how effective memoization is compared to vanilla recursion, let’s use the  module. Comparing this to the  test on  with memoization, the benefits of caching becomes immediately clear: 3 second and 150 nanoseconds are different by orders of magnitude, and we only asked the functions to calculate the 35th fibonacci number. We can get a sense of how quickly this disparity would grow if we try to calculate something like the 1000th fibonacci number in the sequence. Another perk of using caching as above is that we can now get the full sequence up to the 35th fibonacci number. Although memoization is interesting, it is not the main topic of today’s post. Instead, I want to discuss Binet’s formula, a formula with which we can calculate the th fibonacci number. Binet’s formula states that We can trivially verify that  and that .

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","Since this is a very simple CNN, you will see that there is nothing exciting going on; we are simply getting the output of the previous layer and passing that as input into the next.

There is a  that I could have easily used, and indeed there is an entire discussion on the PyTorch forum on the difference between the two. The bottom line is that they are pretty similar for our purposes. The most salient difference between the two is that the functional approach cannot be used when declaring a sequential model. However, since we are defining a custom forward function, this limitation does not apply. Personally, I prefer the functional because it means that there is one less layer to declare in the initialization function. However, it’s probably better to err on the side of the  if you’re not totally sure. Now that we’ve designed and implemented a model, it’s time to train it. This is the part where people might argue that TensorFlow 2 or Keras is superior to PyTorch. In Keras, you can simply call  to train the model.

"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","If there is one thing I recall most succinctly from my high school chemistry class, it is how to use Excel to draw basic plots. In the eyes of a naive freshman, visualizations seemed to add an air of professionalism. So I would always include a graph of some sort in my lab report, even when I knew they were superfluous. The final icing on the cake? A fancy regression with some r-squared. In today’s post, I want to revisit what used to be my favorite tinkering toy in Excel: regression. More specifically, we’ll take a look at linear regression, which deals with straight lines and planes instead of curved surfaces. Although it sounds simple, the linear regression model is still widely used because it not only provides a clearer picture of obtained data, but can also be used to make predictions based on previous observations. Linear regression is also incredibly simple to implement using existing libraries in programming languages such as Python, as we will later see in today’s post. That was a long prologue—–let’s jump right in. In this section, we will attempt to frame regression in linear algebra terms and use basic matrix operations to derive an equation for the line of best fit. In this section, we will use linear algebra to understand regression. An important theme in linear algebra is orthogonality. How do we determine if two vectors—or more generally, two subspaces—are orthogonal to each other? How do we make two non-orthogonal vectors orthogonal? (Hence Gram-Schmidt.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
MLE and KL Divergence,"We will revisit JSD in the future when we discuss the mathematics behind GANs. But for now, it suffices to know what KL divergence is and what it measures. Now that we have reviewed the essential concepts that we need, let’s get down to the proof. Let’s start with the statement of the parameter  that minimizes the KL divergence between the two distribution  and the approximate distribution : Not a lot has happened in this step, except for substituting the  expression with its definition as per (2). Observe that in the last derived expression in (4), the term  does not affect the argument of the minima, which is why it can safely be omitted to yield the following simplified expression: We can change the argument of the minima operator to the maxima given the negative sign in the expression for the expected value. To proceed further, it is necessary to resort to the Law of Large Numbers, or LLN for short. The law states that the average of samples obtained from a large number of repeated trials should be close to the expected value of that random variable. In other words, the average will approximate the expected value as more trials are performed. More formally, LLN might be stated in the following fashion. Suppose we perform an experiment involving the random variable  and repeat it  times. Then, we would obtain a set of indecent and identically distributed (i.i.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"It’s finally time to test the model. Let’s first begin with data preparation and preprocessing. Now, we should have the training and test set ready to be fed into our network. Next, let’s define a simple callback application using the  monitor so that training can be stopped when no substantial improvements are being made to our model. This was included because training a VAE can take some time, and we don’t want to waste computing resources seeing only submarginal increments to the model performance. Training begins! After 14 epochs, training has stopped, meaning that no meaningful improvements were being made. Let’s visualize the representation of the latent space learned by the VAE. Visualizing this representation is easy in this case because we defined the latent space to be two-dimensional; in other words, all points can be plotted on a Cartesian plane. Let’s take a look:  This plot shows us how each numbers are distributed across the latent space. Notice that numbers that belong to the same class seem to be generally clustered around each other, although there is a messy region in the middle. This is a reasonable result: while we would expect ones to be fairly easy to distinguish from, say, eights, numbers like zeros and sixes might look very similar, and hence appear mixed as a lump in the fuzzy region in the middle. One cool thing about VAEs is that we can use their learned representation to see how numbers slowly morph and vary across a specified domain.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Principal Component Analysis,"Let’s consider a single column in , denoted as .

Generalizing this result back to , we see that  is a matrix whose columns correspond to the eigenvectors of  in descending order. If you had prior exposure to PCA, you might know that the standard way of obtaining principal components is by calculating the covariance matrix of the data and finding its eigenvectors. Here, I attempt to present an explanation of how and why the procedure outlined in the preceding section is essentially achieving the same tasks, albeit through a different frame of thought. The unbiased sample covariance matrix is given by Of course, this is operating under the assumption that  has already been standardized such that the mean of the data is zero. You might be thinking that the formulation in (14) looks different from the one introduced previously on this post on SVD. In that particular post, I stated that covariance could be calculated as (14) and (15) certainly look different. However, under the hood, they express the same quantity.

Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"As per convention of this tutorial, the returned dictionary has keys corresponding to each class and values indicating the likelihood that the  belongs to that class. We can see the  function in action by passing a dummy test instance. We are almost done! All that we have to do is to create a funcition that returns the predicted label of a testing instance given some labeled training data. Implemenitng this process is straightforward since we have all the Bayesian ingredients we need, namely the prior and the likelihood. The last step is to connect the dots with Bayes’ theorem by calculating the product of the prior and likelihood for each class, then return the class label with the largest posterior, as illustrated below. Let’s see if the  works as expected by seeing if passing as argument , for which we know that its label is 1, actually returns 1. The function is only able to process a single testing instance. Let’s complete our model construction by writing the  function that takes labeled data and a testing set as its argument to return a  array containing the predicted class labels for each instance in the testing set.

Gamma and Zeta,"At any rate, it’s both interesting and yet also unsurprising to see that these two functions are brainchildren of Gauss and Euler, two names that arguably appear the most in the world of math. The Riemann zeta function is perhaps one of the most famous functions in the world of analysis. It is also sometimes referred to as the Euler-Riemann zeta function, but at this point, prefixing something with “Euler” loses significance since just about everything in mathematics seems to have some Euler prefix in front of it. The Riemann zeta function takes the following form: But this definition, as simple and intuitive as it is, seems to erroneously suggest that the Riemann zeta function is only defined over non-negative integers. This is certainly not the case. In fact, the reason why the Riemann zeta function is so widely studied in mathematics is that its domain ranges over the complex number plane. While we won’t be discussing the complexity of the Riemann zeta function in this regard (no pun intended), it is nonetheless important to consider about how we might calculate, say, . This is where the Gamma function comes in. As hinted earlier, an alternative definition of the Riemann zeta function can be constructed using the Gamma function that takes the Riemann zeta beyond the obvious realm of integers and into the real domain.

Likelihood and Probability,"As our intuition suggests, MLE quickly reduces into an optimization problem, the solution of which can be obtained through various means, such as Newton’s method or gradient descent. For the purposes of this post, we look at the simplest way that involves just a bit of calculus. The best way to demonstrate how MLE works is through examples. In this post, we look at simple examples of maximum likelihood estimation in the context of normal distributions. We have never formally discussed normal distributions on this blog yet, but it is such a widely used, commonly referenced distribution that I decided to jump into MLE with this example. But don’t worry—we will derive the normal distribution in a future post, so if any of this seems overwhelming, you can always come back to this post for reference. The probability density function for the normal distribution, with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\), can be written as follows: Assume we have a list of observations that correspond to the random variable of interest, \(X\). For each \(x_i\) in the sample data, we can calculate the likelihood of a distribution with parameters \(\theta = (\mu, \sigma)\) by calculating the probability densities at each point of the PDF where \(X = x_i\). We can then make the following statement about these probabilities: In other words, to maximize the likelihood simply means to find the value of a parameter that which maximizes the product of probabilities of observing each data point.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Equation (3) can be manipulated in the following manner to finally produce a simple form of Bayes’ theorem: We can motivate a more intricate version this rule by modifying the denominator. Given that \(A\) and \(B\) are discrete events, we can break down \(A\) as a union of intersections between \(A\) and \(B_i\), where \(B_i\) represents subsets within event \(B\). In concrete form, we can rewrite this as Additionally, we can rewrite the conditional probability \(P(A \cap B_i)\) in terms of \(P(B_i)\) and \(P(A \mid B_i)\) according to the definition of conditional probability we observed earlier. Applying these alterations to (4) to rewrite \(P(A)\) produces equation (5): This is the equation of Bayes’ theorem. In simple language, Bayes’ theorem tells us that the conditional probability of some subset \(B_k\) given \(A\) is equal to its relevant fraction within a weighted summation of the conditional probabilities \(A\) given \(B_i\). Although this equation may seem complicated at a glance, we can develop an intuition for this formula by reminding ourselves of the definition of conditional probabilities, as well as the fact that independent events can be expressed as a union of intersections. At the end of the day, Bayes’ theorem provides a powerful tool through which we can calculate a conditional probability in terms of its reverse, i.e. calculate \(P(B \mid A)\) by utilizing \(P(A \mid B)\).

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a famous problem in computer science. The problem might be summarized as follows: imagine you are a salesperson who needs to visit some number of cities. Because you want to minimize costs spent on traveling (or maybe you’re just lazy like I am), you want to find out the most efficient route, one that will require the least amount of traveling. You are given a coordinate of the cities to visit on a map. How can you find the optimal route? The most obvious solution would be the brute force method, where you consider all the different possibilities, calculate the estimated distance for each, and choose the one that is the shortest path. While this is a definite way to solve TSP, the issue with this approach is that it requires a lot of compute—the runtime of this brute force algorithm would be , which is just utterly terrible. In this post, we will consider a more interesting way to approach TSP: genetic algorithms. As the name implies, genetic algorithms somewhat simulate an evolutionary process, in which the principle of the survival of the fittest ensures that only the best genes will have survived after some iteration of evolutionary cycles across a number of generations. Genetic algorithms can be considered as a sort of randomized algorithm where we use random sampling to ensure that we probe the entire search space while trying to find the optimal solution.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"It’s time for some training and prediction generation.

Let’s use this function to test how well our model performed. 99 percent is not a bad estimate at all. One interesting question to consider is how much boost in accuracy we see with each epoch, i.e. what is the bang-per-buck of each iteration cycle? This is an important question to consider because gradient descent is computationally expensive; if we can train our model in just 10 epochs instead of 1000, why not choose the former?

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"I have been putting off with blog postsings lately, largely because I was preoccupied with learning new languages I decided to pick up out of whim.

I still have no idea where this spontaneous journey will take me, but hopefully I can make use of it in one way or another. The topic for today’s post is Monte Carlo methods, something that I have been very interested in for a long time, admittedly because of its eye-catching name. Contrary to my original expectation, Monte Carlo is not named after an eponymous mathematician, but a gambling hot spot in Monaco. The logic behind this nomenclature is that the simulation of random outcomes, such as in the context of an unpredictable gambling game, is what Monte Carlo methods are best suited for. To present a more formal definition, Monte Carlo methods refer to a broad category of  algorithms that use repeated random sampling to make estimations of unknown parameters. Basically, MC methods work by cleverly sampling from a distribution to estimate a variable of interest. This versatility is why MC method is such a powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. In today’s post, we will attempt to solve various bite-sized tasks using MC methods. These tasks will be of varying difficulty, but taken together, they will collectively demonstrate the useful applications of MC methods.

MLE and KL Divergence,"d, which is the assumption that we make to build models such as naïve Bayes, and so on. For now, it suffices to clarify that the goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the optimal parameter of a distribution that best captures some given data. KL divergence is a concept that arises from the field of information theory that is also heavily applied in statistics and machine learning. KL divergence is particularly useful because it can be used to measure the dissimilarity between to probability distributions. The familiar equation for KL divergence goes as follows: In Bayesian terms, KL divergence might be used to compare the prior and the posterior distribution, where  represents the posterior and , the prior. In machine learning,  is often the true distribution which we seek to model, and  is the approximation of that true distribution, which is also the prediction generated by the model. Note that KL divergence is not a true measure of distance, since it is asymmetric. In other words, The focus of this post is obviously not on distance metrics, and I plan on writing a separate post devoted to this topic. But as a preview of what is to come, here is an appetizer to get you interested.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"I’ve been using a music streaming service for the past few weeks, and it’s been a great experience so far.

Having processed these information through repeated user input on my part, the streaming application now regularly generates playlists each reflective of the three different genres of music that I enjoy most. This got me wondering: what is the underlying algorithm beind content selection and recommendation? How do prominent streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify provide recommendations to their users that seem to reflect their personal preferences and tastes? From a business perspective, these questions carry extreme significance since the accuracy of a recommendation algorithm may directly impact sales revenue. In this post, we will dive into this question by developing an elementary recommendation engine. The mechanism we will use to achieve this objective is a technique in linear algebra known as singular value decomposition or SVD for short. SVD is an incredibly powerful way of processing data, and also ties in with other important techniques in applied statistics such as principal component analysis, which we might also take a look at in a future post.

The Gibbs Sampler,"So at this point, we have now empirically checked that Gibbs sampling indeed works: even if we can’t directly sample from the distribution, if we have access to conditional distributions, we can still achieve an asymptotically similar result. Now comes the mathematics portion of deriving the conditional distribution of a multivariate Gaussian, as promised earlier. In this section, we will derive an expression for the conditional distribution of the multivariate Gaussian. This isn’t really relevant to the Gibbs sampling algorithm itself, since the sampler can be used in non-Gaussian contexts as long as we have access to conditional distributions. Nonetheless, deriving this is a good mental exercise that merits some discussion. Just for the sake of quick review, let’s briefly revisit the familiar definition of a conditional probability: In the context of random vectors, we can rewrite this as Of course, if  and  are scalars, we go back to the familiar bivariate context of our example. In short, deriving the expression for the conditional distribution simply amounts to simplifying the fraction whose denominator is the marginal distribution and the numerator is the joint distribution. Let’s clarify the setup and notation first. We define a -dimensional random vector that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, namely .

Dissecting LSTMs,"Notice that we use a  activation instead of a sigmoid, since the aim of (3) is not to produce a filter with sparse entries, but rather to generate substance, or potential information to be stored in memory. This is more in line with the classic vanilla neural network architecture we are familiar with. Now, we can finally glue the pieces together to understand (4): we enforce forgetfulness, then supply the cell state with new information. This is now the updated cell state, which gets passed onto the next sequence as new inputs are fed into the LSTM. So far, we have only looked at the recurrent features of LSTM; in other words, how it uses information from the past to update its knowledge in the present at time . However, we haven’t yet discussed the most important part of any neural network: generating output. Obviously, all that hassle of forgetting and updating the cell state would be utterly meaningless if the cell state is not used to generate output. The whole purpose of maintaining a cell state, therefore, is to imitate long and short-term memory of the brain to generate some output.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"In a previous post, we took a look at Fisher’s information matrix. Today, we will be taking a break from the R frenzy and continue our exploration of this topic, meshing together related ideas such as gradient descent, KL divergence, Hessian, and more. The typical formula for batch gradient descent looks something like this: This is the familiar gradient descent algorithm that we know of. While this approach works and certainly makes sense, there are definite limitations; hence the introduction of other more efficient algorithms such as SGD, Adam, and et cetera. However, these algorithms all have one thing in common: they adjust the parameter in the parameter space according to Euclidean distance. In other words, gradient descent essentially looks at regions that are some Euclidean distance away from the current parameter and chooses the direction of steepest descent. This is where the notion of natural gradients come into play: if our goal is to minimize the cost function, which is effectively equivalent to maximizing the likelihood, why not search within the distribution space of the likelihood function instead? After all, this makes more sense since gradient descent in parameter space is likely to be easily perturbed by the mode of parametrization, such as using precision instead of variance in a normal distribution, whereas searching in the distribution space would not be subject to this limitation. So the alternative to this approach would be to search the distribution space and find the distribution that which makes value of the cost function the smallest.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
"0.5!: Gamma Function, Distribution, and More","We start with two parameters, \(\alpha > 0\) and \(\beta > 0\), using which we can construct a Gamma function. We can divide both sides by \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) to obtain the following expression: We can then apply the substitution \(x = \beta y\) to obtain Notice that we can consider the integrand to be a probability distribution function since the result of integration over the prescribed domain yields 1, the total probability. Seen this way, we can finally delineate a definition of the Gamma distribution as follows, with a trivial substitution of parameters. If this derivation involving the Gamma function does not click with you, we can take the alternative route of starting from the functional definition of the Gamma distribution: the Gamma distribution models the waiting time until the occurrence of the \(k\)th event in a Poisson process. In other words, given some rate \(\lambda\) which denotes the rate at which an event occurs, what is the distribution of the waiting time going to look like? The Gamma distribution holds an answer to this question. Let’s jump right into derivation. The first ingredient we need is the equation for the Poisson probability mass function, which we might recall goes as follows: \(k\) denotes the number of events that occur in unit time, while \(\lambda\) denotes the rate of success. To generalize this formula by removing the unit time constraint, we can perform a rescaling on \(\lambda\) to produce the following: where \(P(X = k)\) denotes the probability that \(k\) events occur within time \(t\).",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"This means that, application-wise, the Beta distribution is most often used to model a distribution of probabilities, say the batting average of a baseball player as shown in this post. It is also worth noting that the Beta function, which serves as a coefficient in the equation for the Beta PDF, serves as a normalization constant to ensure that integrating the function over the domain \([0, 1]\) would yield 1 as per the definition of a PDF. To see this, one needs to prove This is left as an exercise for the keen reader. We will revisit this problem in a separate post. Another reason why the Beta distribution is an excellent choice for our prior representation is that it is a conjugate prior to the binomial distribution. Simply put, this means that using the Beta distribution as our prior, combined with a binomial likelihood function, will produce a posterior  that also follows a Beta distribution. This fact is crucial for Bayesian analysis. Recall that the beauty of Bayesian inference originates from repeated applicability: a posterior we obtain after a single round of calculation can be used as a prior to perform the next iteration of inference. In order to ensure the ease of this procedure, intuitively it is necessary for the prior and the posterior to take the same form of distribution. Conjugate priors streamline the Bayesian process of updating our priors with posteriors by ensuring that this condition is satisfied. In simple language, mathematicians have found that certain priors go well with certain likelihoods.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Dissecting LSTMs,"where, given a concatenation operator , Now we are done!

Note that  had been concatenated to the input in the form of  throughout the forward pass. Because this was a variable that was used during computation, we need to calculate its gradient as well. This might appear rather confusing since we are currently looking at time , and it seems as if the gradient for  variables should be happening in the next iteration of backpropagation. While this is certainly true for the most part, due to the recurrent nature of LSTMs, we need to compute these gradients for  in this step as well. This is precisely what we were talking about earlier when discussing the recurrent nature of backprop; the  we compute here will be used in the next iteration of backpropagation, just like we added  in the current backprop to calculate .

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"Using (11), we can proceed in a different direction from the definition of KL divergence. Once again, we have shown that KL divergence is positive! Proving this isn’t really necessary in the grand scheme of exploring the mathematics behind VAEs, yet I thought it would help to have this adjunctive section to better understand KL divergence and familiarize ourselves with some standard algebraic manipulations that are frequently invoked in many derivations. Let’s jump back into variational inference and defining the cost function with ELBO. Recall from the setup of our Variational Autoencoder model that we have defined the latent vector as living in two-dimensional space following a multivariate Gaussian distribution. It’s time to apply the ELBO equation to this specific context and derive a closed-form expression of our loss function. Let’s recall the formula for ELBO: After some rearranging, we can decompose ELBO into two terms, one of which is a KL divergence: Now, it’s finally time for us to dive deep into math: let’s unpack the closed form expression in (13). Note that the ELBO expression applies to just about any distribution, but since we chose a multivariate Gaussian to be the base distribution, we will see how it unfolds specifically in this context. Let’s begin by assuming the distribution of our models to be Gaussian.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Gaussian Mixture Models,"Before we get into the details of what the EM algorithm is, it’s perhaps best to provide a very brief overview of how the EM algorithm works. A very simple way to understand EM is to think of the Gibbs sampler. Simply put, Gibbs sampling is a way of approximating some joint distribution given conditional distributions. The underlying idea was to sample from one distribution and use that sampled result to in turn generate another sample from the next conditional distribution. One might visualize this as a chain of circular dependence: if we obtain a sample from past samples, the new sample can then be used to generate the next sample. Repeat this process until convergence, and we are done. Turns out that the Gibbs sampler can be considered a specific flavor of the EM method. Although I am still far away from fully understanding the inner-workings of the EM algorithm, the underlying idea is clear: given some sort of dependence relationship, much like we saw in the case of Gibbs sampling above, we can generate some sample in one iteration and use that sample in the next. As we will see in this section, such a relationship can clearly be established, which is why EM is so commonly used in the context of Gaussian mixture models. Let’s begin by defining some quantities, the first being the posterior distribution.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"I was almost about to stop here, but then decided that I wanted to express the neural network model as a Python class. After all, that is how actual machine learning and deep learning libraries are implemented. I also decided that it can’t hurt for me to practice object-oriented thinking. So presented in the next section is a nicer, cleaner implementation of a neural network model based off of the functions we designed above. A simple neural network model in just 56 lines of code, ready to be initialized, trained, deployed, and tested! You will see that much of the code is literally just copy and pasted from the original functions we designed above. But just to make sure that everything works fine, let’s try creating a neural network object and use the  function to see how well our model performs. I chose 99 as the number of neurons in the affine layers for no reason. In this instance, the accuracy of this model is 95 percent, similar to what we had above. At this point, one question that popped up in my mind was the relationship between the number of neurons and the performance of the neural network model. Intuitively, the more neurons there are, the higher the memory capacity of that model, and thus better the performance. Of course, the larger the number of neurons, the larger the risk of overfitting our model, which can also negatively impact the performance of the neural network. This is conventional wisdom in the land of deep learning.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
My First GAN,"Now that we have an idea of what the function accomplishes, let’s use it to start training. The  seems to fluctuate a bit, which is not necessarily a good sign but also quite a common phenomenon in GAN training. GANs are notoriously difficult to train, since it requires balancing the performance of the generator and the discriminator in such a way that one does not overpower the other. This is referred to as a min-max game in game theory terms, and finding an equilibrium in such structures are known to be difficult. Let’s take a look at the results now that the iterations are over.  The created images are admittedly fuzzy, pixelated, and some even somewhat alien-looking. This point notwithstanding, I find it incredibly fascinating to see that at least some generated images actually resemble ships in the sea. Of particular interest to me are the red ships that appear in  and . Given the simplicity of the structure of our network, I would say that this is a successful result. Let’s take a look at the learning curve of the GAN.  As you might expect, the loss is very spiky and erratic. This is why it is hard to determine when to stop training a GAN. Of course, there are obvious signs of failure: when the loss of one component starts to get exponentially larger or smaller than its competitor, for instance.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"The main takeaway here is the the gradient descent method allows us to find the local minimum of any convex function, no matter how multidimensional or complex. This is an incredibly powerful statement, and it is one that lies at the core of many machine learning algorithms. To implement gradient descent with code, we have to figure out what the gradient descent equation is in the case of logistic regression. To do this, we need a bit of calculus work using the chain rule. Recall that our goal is to compute since we want to calculate the slope of the cross entropy function with respect to the weights vector. For notational convenience, let’s denote the gradient as a derivative: The gradient in (7) can be broken down into distinct components via the chain rule: where So the task of calculating the gradient now boils down to finding the derivative for each of the terms shown in (8). Let’s start with the easiet one, the last term, which is the derivative of  with respect to . From (9), we can conclude that The next in line is the derivative of the sigmoid function, which goes as follows: Now we are almost there. The last piece of the puzzle is computing the first term in (8), the derivative of the cross entropy function. Putting this all together into (8), we get: Voila!

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Because computing the softmax function require exponentiation, it is likely for the computer to end up with very large numerical quantities, making calculations unstable. One way to solve this problem is by subtracting values from the exponent. As the calculation shows, adding or subtracting the same value from the exponent of both the numerator and the denominator creates no difference for the output of the softmax function. Therefore, we can prevent numbers from getting too large by subtracting some value from the exponent, thus yielding accurate results from stable computation. We can further improve the softmax function for the purposes of this tutorial by supporting batch computation. By batch, I simply mean multiple inputs in the form of arrays. The function shown above is only able to account for a single vector, presumably given as a list or a one-dimensional numpy array. The implementation below uses a loop to calculate the softmax output of each instance in a matrix input, then returns the result. Note that it also prevents arithematic overflow by subtracting the  value of the input array. Let’s test the improved softmax function with a two-dimensional array containing two instances.

Now that we have all the things we need, let’s jump into some data preparation and modeling. Another thing I love about PyTorch is the sheer ease with which you can preprocess data. PyTorch makes it incredibly easy to combine and stack multiple transforms to create custom transformations to be applied to the dataset. The easiest way to go about this is to use the  method, which looks like this: Here, we are applying to transformations: the first changes the dataset and casts it into PyTorch tensors,, and the second one normalizes the dataset to have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of also 0.5 across all three channels of RGB. How can we apply this transform? Well, we can pass it to initialize the datasets as shown below: Because I already have the CIFAR10 downloaded in the  directory of my local, PyTorch does not download the dataset again.

The Gibbs sampler is another very interesting algorithm we can use to sample from complicated, intractable distributions. Although the use case of the Gibbs sampler is somewhat limited due to the fact that we need to be able to access the conditional distribution, it is a powerful algorithm nonetheless. We also discussed the notion of conditional distributions of the multivariate Gaussian in this post. The derivation was not the simplest, and granted we omitted a lot of algebra along the way, but it was a good mental exercise nonetheless.

BLEU from scratch,"Now we’re almost done. The last example to consider is the following translation: This is obviously a bad translation. However, due to the way modified precision is currently being calculated, this sentence will likely earn a high score. To prevent this from happening, we need to apply what is known as brevity penalty. As the name implies, this penalizes short candidate translations, thus ensuring that only sufficiently long machine translations are ascribed a high score. Although this might seem confusing, the underlying mechanism is quite simple. The goal is to find the length of the reference sentence whose length is closest to that of the candidate translation in question. If the length of that reference sentence is larger than the candidate sentence, we apply some penalty; if the candidate sentence is longer, than we do not apply any penalization. The specific formula for penalization looks as follows: The brevity penalty term is multiplied to the n-gram modified precision. Therefore, a value of 1 means that no penalization is applied. Let’s perform a quick sanity check to see whether the brevity penalty function works as expected. Finally, it’s time to put all the pieces together. The formula for BLEU can be written as follows: First, some notation clarifications.  specifies the size of the bag of word, or the n-gram.  denotes the weight we will ascribe to the modified precision——produced under that -gram configuration.

It’s important to keep in mind that these samples are each 50-dimensional vectors—in a sense, they can be considered as “functions”, which is why the Gaussian process is often referred to as sampling functions from a multivariate Gaussian. Let’s plot the final result, alongside the actual function . In red, I’ve also plotted the average of all the 50 samples to see how accurate the result holds up.

Complex Fibonacci,"The takeaway from the code snippet is that holds, regardless of whether or not  is a non-negative integer. Indeed, Binet’s formula gives us what we might refer to as the interpolation of the fibonacci sequence, in this case extended along the real number line. A corollary of the real number interpolation of the fibonacci sequence via Binet’s formula is that now we can effectively plot the complex fibonacci numbers on the Cartesian plane. Because  can be continuous, we would expect some graph to appear, where the -axis represents real numbers, and , the imaginary. This requires a bit of a hack though; note that the result of Binet’s formula is a complex number, or a two-dimensional data point. The input to the function is just a one-dimensional real number. Therefore, we need a way of representing a map from a one-dimensional real number line to a two-dimensional complex plane. This is sort of tricky if you think about it: the normal two-dimensional plane as we know it can only represent a mapping from the -axis to the -axis—in other words, a transformation from one-dimensional space to another one-dimensional space. A three-dimensional -coordinate system, on the other hand, represents a transformation from a two-dimensional space, represented by  and , to another one-dimensional space, namely .

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Let’s cut to the chase: RNNs emulate memory by using the output from the previous sequence as an input to the next. Perhaps writing this down in matrix notation might give you a better idea of what the statement above means. Here is one way we might implement a very simple recurrent neural network. If the word “recursion” pops up into your mind, then you are on the right track. Notice that in calculating , the output of the current sequence, the output of the previous sequence,  is used. By using the output of the previous sequence, the recurrent neural network is able to “remember” some of the information that was produced by the previous input. Granted, this is not exactly what memory is or how it works in the strictest sense, but we can see how some information from the previous input is trickling down to affect the computation of the current sequence of input data. Note that I used  for the example, but we can just about use any other activation function. Here is one way we might implement this in Python. Although not necessary, I decided to opt for a class-based implementation to make things look tight and nicer. Let’s create a  class object to see that everything works properly.

Logistic Regression Model from Scratch,"We see that accuracy spikes up on the first 20- epochs or so and quite quickly converges to about 90 percent. Past a certain threshold, the model seems to hover consistently at around the high 90s range, but accuracy still continues to increase ever so slightly with each epoch, though not as quickly as before. If we set the learning rate  to a smaller number, we would expect the model to take a lot longer to tune, and indeed this seems to be true:  With a much smaller learning rate, the model seems to struggle to achieve high accuracy. However, although there are a lot of uneven spikes, the model still manages to reach a pretty high accuracy score by 200 epochs. This tells us that the success of model training depends a lot on how we set the learning rate; setting an excessively high value for the learning rate might result in overshooting, while a low learning rate might prevent the model from quickly learning from the data and making meaningful progress. Accuracy helps us intuitively understand how well our model is doing, but recall that the main objective of gradient descent is not to maximize accuracy, but to minimize the cross entropy loss function.

Convex Combinations and MAP,"And we have derived the MAP estimate for the mean of the univariate Gaussian! Maximum a posteriori analysis is great and all, but what does the final result exactly tell us?

Simply put, a convex combination is a linear combination of different points or quantities in which the coefficients of the linear combinations add up to one. More concretely, We can also imagine that  and  are each -dimensional vectors, and that a convex combination is simply a dot product of these two vectors given that the elements of  sum up to one.

Likelihood and Probability,"We can see this in action with a simple line of code. This code block creates two distributions of different parameters, \(N_1~(1, 0)\) and \(N_2~(0.5, 0.7)\). Then, we assume that a sample of value 1 is observed. Then, we can compare the likelihood of the two parameters given this data by comparing the probability density of the data for each of the two distributions. In this case, \(N_2\) seems more likely, i.e. it better explains the data \(X = 1\) since \(L(\theta_{N_1} \mid 1) \approx 0.4416\), which is larger than \(L(\theta_{N_2} \mid 1) \approx 0.2420\). To sum up, likelihood is something that we can say about a distribution, specifically the parameter of the distribution. On the other hand, probabilities are quantities that we ascribe to individual data. Although these two concepts are easy to conflate, and indeed there exists an important relationship between them explained by Bayes’ theorem, yet they should not be conflated in the world of mathematics. At the end of the day, both of them provide interesting ways to analyze the organic relationship between data and distributions. Maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE in short, is an important technique used in many subfields of statistics, most notably Bayesian statistics.

PyTorch Tensor Basics,"More generally speaking, we can think that concatenation effectively brought the two elements of each tensor together to form a larger tensor of four elements.

The trick is to mentally draw a connection between the dimension of concatenation and the location of the opening and closing brackets that we should focus on. In the case of the example above, the opening and closing brackets were the outer most ones. In the example below in which we concatenate along the first dimension, the brackets are those that form the boundary of the inner two-dimensional 3-by-4 tensor. Let’s take a look.

For the sake of completeness, let’s also take a look at the very last case, where we concatenate along the last dimension.

For now, it suffices to show the general probability function as well as its building blocks, namely the Beta function itself. These will become relevant later when we derive the posterior with a binomial likelihood function to show conjugacy. To prove conjugacy, it suffices to show that multiplying a Beta prior with a binomial likelihood produces a Beta posterior. Roughly speaking, the big picture we will be using is essentially equation (1). For notation consistency, I decided to use  for conditional probability and  for function parametrization. For a rather pedantic discussion on this notational convention, I recommend that you take a quick look at this cross validated post. Let’s now plug in the Beta and binomial distributions into (5) to see what comes out of it. This is going to be a lot of computation, but the nice part of it is that a lot of terms cancel out each other. We can easily see that there are constant that exist both in the numerator and the denominator.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Bayesian Linear Regression,"Whereas vanilla linear regression only gives us a single point estimate given an input vector, Bayesian linear regression gives an entire distribution. For the purposes of our demonstration, we will define the predictive posterior to take the following form as shown below, with precision  pre-given. Precision is simply the reciprocal of variance and is commonly used as an alternative way of parametrizing Gaussian distributions. In other words, we assume the model Our goal will be to derive a posterior for this distribution by performing Bayesian inference on , which corresponds to the slope of the linear regression equation, where  denotes noise and randomness in the data, thus affecting our final prediction. To begin Bayesian inference on parameter , we need to specify a prior. Our uninformed prior will look as follows. where  denotes precision, the inverse of variance. Note that we have a diagonal covariance matrix in place of variance, the distribution for  will be a multivariate Gaussian. The next ingredient we need for our recipe is the likelihood function. Recall that likelihood can intuitively be understood as an estimation of how likely it is to observe the given data points provided some parameter for the true distribution of these samples. The likelihood can easily be computed by referencing back to equation (1) above. Note that the dot product of  with itself yields the sum of the exponents, which is precisely the quantity we need when computing the likelihood.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Principal Component Analysis,"I found this to be the more dominant interpretation of PCA, since indeed it is highly intuitive: the goal of PCA is to find the axes—or the principal components—that which maximize the variance seen in the data. setosa.io has some excellent visualizations on the notion of covariance and how it relates to PCA, so I highly recommend that you go check it out. If were to derive PCA from the gecko with the covariance approach, we would be using an iterative approach to find a single principal component at a time. Specifically, our goal would be to find  that which maximizes Hence the problem is now framed as a constrained optimization problem. We use Lagrangians to solve constrained optimization. The intuition for the Lagrangian method is that the gradient of the constraint and the argument should be parallel to each other at the point of optimization. We go about this by taking the gradient of the argument with respect to : Since 2 is just a constant, we can absorb it into  to form a more concise expression. Also, since the covariance matrix is by definition symmetric, we can simplify things further to end up with And once again, we have shown that the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"Visually, we can imagine the neuron being lit up when the value  is large.  This is similar to how the human brain works, except that biological neurons are binary in that they either fires on or off; artifical neurons in a network typically take a range of values. If we expand the vector operation in (5), it becomes quickly obvious that we can represent an entire layer of neurons as a product of two matrices. Our simple neural network model can thus be expressed as follows: The equations above represent our simple neural network model composed of two affine layers. The output of the first affine layer, , is modified by a ReLU unit. Then, the output is passed onto the second affine layer, , the output of which is passed onto a softmax unit. The output of the softmax function is the final output of our model. Note that ReLU and softmax are denoted as max and sigma, respectively. The code below is a function that intializes our network. Because our  data only has two classes, with each data point containing two entries corresponding to the  and  coordinates of that point, we set both  and  arguments to 2 by default. The number of neurons in the affine layers, denoted as , is arbitrarily set to 64. The  returns a dictionary that contains all the weights of the model.

Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"All the steps prior to the model would involve wrangling the data; the last step would have the model use the data to make a prediction.

If the pipeline itself is just a bundle of preprocessors, on the other hand, we should only be able to call . Scikit-learn’s models are great, but in a sense they are too great. This is because there are a lot of hypterparameters to tune. Fortunately for us, we can somewhat resort to a quasi-brute force approach to deal with this: train models on a number of different combinations of hyperparameters and find the one that performs best! Well, this is what  does.  is not quite as bad in that it doesn’t create and test all possible models that distinct combinations of hyperparameters can yield: instead, it relies on a randomized algorithm to perform a search of the hyperparameter space.

The parameter space we are searching for here is by no means exhaustive, but it covers a fair amount of ground.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Although the rate of convergence dramatically decreases after the first few iterations, the pattern of convergence is apparrent. So how does this work? The mechanism is extremely simple: if we were to randomly generate an infinite number of dots, the proportion of the number of dots that fall within the circle versus those that do not fall within it would converge to some constant, i.e. \(\pi:4-\pi\). Why is this the case? Intuitively, the larger the area, the larger the number of points that fall into that area. Given this proportional relationship, the number of randomly generated points in an area after a simulation would mirror the actual area of the circle and the rectangle, hence the proportional expression above. By following this line of reasoning, we can then resort to Monte Carlo to generate these random points, after which we can make a reasonable estimation of \(\pi\). But approximation is not the only domain in which Monte Carlo methods become useful–they can also be used to calculate complicated integrals. We all know from calculus class that integration can be difficult. Everyone has encountered integrals of varying monstrosity at one point in their lives, scrambling to solve it with integration by parts or some obscure, creative substitution, only to realize that everything wounds up in the middle of nowhere.

Understanding PageRank,"Google is the most popular search engine in the world. It is so popular that the word “Google” has been [added to the Oxford English Dictionary] as a proper verb, denoting the act of searching on Google. While Google’s success as an Internet search engine might be attributed to a plethora of factors, the company’s famous PageRank algorithm is undoubtedly a contributing factor behind the stage. [The PageRank algorithm] is a method by which Google ranks different pages on the world wide web, displaying the most relevant and important pages on the top of the search result when a user inputs an entry. Simply put, PageRank determines which websites are most likely to contain the information the user is looking for and returns the most optimal search result. While the nuts and bolts of this algorithm may appear complicated—and indeed they are—the underlying concept is surprisingly intuitive: the relevance or importance of a page is determined by the number of hyperlinks going to and from the website. Let’s hash out this proposition by creating a miniature version of the Internet. In our microcosm, there are only five websites, represented as nodes on a network graph.

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"Because the multiplying any arbitrary vector by the identity matrix returns the vector itself, all vectors in the dimensional space can be considered an eigenvector to the matrix \(I\), with \(\lambda\) = 1. A formal way to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be derived from the equation above. Since \(x\) is assumed as a nonzero vector, we can deduce that the matrix \((A - \lambda I)\) is a singular matrix with a nontrivial null space. In fact, the vectors in this null space are precisely the eigenvectors that we are looking for. Here, it is useful to recall that the a way to determine the singularity of a matrix is by calculating its determinant. Using these set of observations, we can modify the equation above to the following form: By calculating the determinant of \((A - \lambda I)\), we can derive the characteristic polynomial, from which we can obtain the set of eigenvectors for \(A\) representing some linear transformation \(T\). Now that we have reviewed some underlying concepts, perhaps it is time to apply our knowledge to a concrete example. Before we move on, I recommend that you check out this post I have written on the Markov process, just so that you are comfortable with the material to be presented in this section.

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"Recently, a friend recommended me a book, Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet. As an eager learner just starting to fiddle with the Keras API, I decided it was a good starting point. I have just finished the first section of Part 2 on Convolutional Neural Networks and image processing. My impression so far is that the book is more focused on code than math. The apparent advantage of this approach is that it shows readers how to build neural networks very transparently. It’s also a good introduction to many neural network models, such as CNNs or LSTMs. On the flip side, it might leave some readers wondering why these models work, concretely and mathematically. This point notwithstanding, I’ve been enjoying the book very much so far, and this post is a reflection of just that. Today, we will use TensorFlow’s  module to build a convolutional neural network for image detection. This code is based on what I have learned from the book, so much credit goes to Deep Learning with Python. I have also looked at Machine Learning Mastery blog for additional reference. Let’s begin! Below are the modules that we will need to import for this demonstration. Note that this Jupyter Notebook was written on Google Colaboratory.

My First GAN,"For this tutorial, we will be using images of ships, which are labeled as 8. So let’s go ahead and specify that. We see that  contains 6000 images, which is more than enough to start training our GAN. To train the GAN, we will define a  function. Essentially, this function creates binary labels for real and fake images. Recall that the goal of the discriminator is to successfully discern generated images from real ones. Also recall that to create generated images, the generator needs to sample from a latent dimension. In other words, training will consist of the following steps: These high level abstractions are what  implements behind the scenes. There are several subtleties that deserve our attention. First, we fade out the labels ever so slightly to expedite the training process. These are little magic tricks that people have found to work well on GAN training. While I’m not entirely sure about the underlying principle, it most likely comes from the fact that having a smooth manifold is conducive to the training of a neural network. Second, coercing a true label on the GAN essentially trains the generator. Note that we never explicitly address the generator in the function; instead, we only train the discriminator. By coercing a true label on the GAN, we are effectively forcing the generator to produce more compelling images, and penalizing it when it fails to do so.

Word2vec from Scratch,"For backpropagation, we will need all the intermediate variables, so we hold them in a dictionary called .

We also have to implement the  function we used above. Note that this function receives a matrix as input, not a vector, so we will need to slightly tune things up a bit using a simple loop. At this point, we are done with implementing the forward pass. However, before we move on, it’s always a good idea to check the dimensionality of the matrices, as this will provide us with some useful intuition while coding backward propagation later on. The dimensionality of the matrix after passing the first layer, or the embedding layer, is as follows: This is expected, since we want all the 330 tokens in the text to be converted into ten-dimensional vectors. Next, let’s check the dimensionality after passing through the second layer. This time, it is a 330-by-60 matrix. This also makes sense, since we want the output to be sixty dimensional, back to the original dimensions following one-hot encoding. This result can then be passed onto the softmax layer, the result of which will be a bunch probability vectors.

Gaussian Process Regression,"In this post, we will explore the Gaussian Process in the context of regression.

I highly recommend that you check out these resources, as they are both very beginner friendly and build up each concept from the basics. With that out of the way, let’s get started. Let’s begin by considering the classic setup of a regression problem. The goal of regression is to predict some values given a set of observations, otherwise referred to as a training set. There are of course many variants of the regression problem. For instance, in a previous post we took a look at Bayesian linear regression, where instead of a single point estimate, we tried to derive a distribution of the predicted data at a given test point. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are similar to Bayesian linear regression in that the final result is a distribution which we can sample from.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"This is why we use bytes to represent the amount of disk storage in computers, for instance. It is also worth mentioning that the alternative name for bits is Shannons, named eponymously after the mathematician who pioneered the field of information theory, as mentioned above. Now that we have some idea of what information is and how we can quantify it using binary numbers in bits, it’s time to get into the math. Information can be calculated through the formula where  is the information need to express the random event , and  is the probability that event  occurs, i.e. . There are different versions of this formula, such as the one that uses Euler’s constant as the log base instead of 2. Whereas the unit of information as measured through (1) is in bits, that calculated through (2) as shown below is in the unit of nats. For the purposes of this post, we will be using equation (1) instead of two. This is primarily because we will be using the binary number analogy to build an intuition for information computation. Let’s quickly create a visualization that shows the relationship between probability and information in bits. As equation (1) describes this relationship quite concisely, let’s try plotting it on a graph.

Complex Fibonacci,"With some algebra, one can verify that Putting these together, we finally get Binet’s formula: An interesting point to note about Binet’s formula is that  doesn’t necessarily have to be a non-negative integer as we had previously assumed. In fact, it can be any number: rational, irrational, real, or even complex. The fact that the fibonacci numbers can extend to real number indexing becomes more apparent once we code out the formula. Nothing special at all, this is just a literal transcription of the formula presented above. But now, watch what happens when we try to get the 1.1th fibonacci number, for instance: Lo and behold, we get a complex fibonacci number! I thought this was so fascinating, almost like seeing a magic of some sort. Although I had known about the fibonacci sequence for as long as I can remember, I had never thought about it in continuous terms: in my mind, the fibonacci sequence was, after all, a sequence—a discrete set of numbers adhering to the simple rule that the next number in line is the sum of the previous two. The intriguing part is that, even in this complex fibonacci madness, the simple rule still holds.

"Linear Regression, in Two Ways",") In our case, we love orthogonality because they are key to deriving the equation for the line of best fit through projection. To see what this means, let’s quickly assume a toy example to work with: assume we have three points, \((1, 1), (2, 2)\) and \((3, 2)\), as shown below.  As we can see, the three points do not form a single line. Therefore, it’s time for some regression. Let’s assume that this line is defined by \(y = ax + b\). The system of equations which we will attempt to solve looks as follows: Or if you prefer the vector-matrix representation as I do, This system, remind ourselves, does not have a solution because we have geometrically observed that no straight line can pass through all three points. What we can do, however, is find a projection of the vector \(y\) onto matrix \(A\) so that we can identify a solution that is closest to \(y\), which we shall denote as \(\hat{y}\). As you can see, this is where all the linear algebra kicks in. Let’s start by thinking about \(\hat{y}\), the projection of \(y\) onto \(A\). After some thinking, we can convince ourselves that \(\hat{y}\) is the component of \(y\) that lives within the column space of \(A\), and that \(y - \hat{y}\) is the error component of \(y\) that lives outside the column space of \(A\). From this, it follows that \(y - \hat{y}\) is orthogonal to \(C(A)\), since any non-orthogonal component would have been factored into \(\hat{y}\).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The Magic of Euler’s Identity,"The implication of this observation is that the trajectory expressed by the vector \(e^{it}\) is essentially that of a circle, with respect to time \(t\). More specifically, we see that at \(t = 0\), \(e^{it} = e^0 = 1\), or \(1 + 0i\), which means that the circle necessarily passes through the point \((1, 0)\) on the complex plane expressed as an Argand graph. From this analysis, we can learn that the trajectory is not just any circle, but a unit circle centered around the origin. But there’s even more! Recall that the velocity vector of the trajectory is a 90-degree rotation of the position vector, i.e. \(e^{it} \perp ie^{it}\), \(\lVert e^{it} \rVert = \lVert ie^{it} \rVert\). Earlier, we concluded that the trajectory expressed by the vector \(e^{it}\) is a unit circle, which necessarily means that \(\lVert e^{it} \rVert = 1\) for all values of \(t\). Then, syllogism tells us that \(\lVert ie^{it} \rVert\) is also one, i.e. the particle on the trajectory moves at unit speed along the unit circle! Now we finally have a full visualization of the position vector. The blue arrow represents the position vector at \(t = 0\); green, the velocity vector also at \(t = 0\). Why is speed important? Unit speed implies that the particle moves by \(t\) distance units after \(t\) time units. Let’s say that \(\pi\) time units have passed.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bayesian Linear Regression,"MAP versus MLE is a recurring theme that appears throughout the paradigmatic shift from frequentist to Bayesian, so it merits discussion. Now that we have a posterior distribution for  which we can work with, it’s time to derive the predictive distribution. We go about this by marginalizing  using the property of conditional probability, as illustrated below. This may seem like a lot, but most of it was simple calculation and distributing vectors over parentheses. It’s time to use the power of conjugacy again to extract a normal distribution out of the equation soup. Let’s complete the square of the exponent according to the Gaussian form after making the appropriate substitutions Again, observing this is not a straightforward process, especially if we had no idea what the final distribution is going to look like. However, given that the resulting predictive posterior will take a Gaussian form, we can backtrack using this knowledge to obtain the appropriate substitution parameters in (13). Continuing, where the last equality stands because we can pull out terms unrelated to  by considering them as constants. Why do we bother to pull out the exponent? This is because the integral of a probability density function evaluates to 1, leaving us only with the exponential term outside the integral.

From the perspective of maximum likelihood estimation, the goal then would be to maximize this likelihood to find the optimal parameters for  and . Before we attempt MLE with the likelihood function, let’s first try to calculate the log likelihood, as this often makes MLE much easier by decoupling products as summations. Let . And now we see a problem: the log is not applied to the inside of the function due to the summation. This is bad news since deriving this expression by  will become very tedious. The result is for sure not going to look pretty, let’s try deriving the log likelihood by  and set it equal to zero. At least one good news is that, for now, we can safely ignore the outer summation given the linearity of derivatives. We ultimately end up with the expression below: This is not pretty at all, and it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to solve analytically for .

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"Conceptually, we can think of  as the previous point of the parameter and  as the newly updated parameter. In this context, the KL divergence would tell us the effect of one iteration of natural gradient descent. This time, instead of using integral, let’s try to simplify a bit by expressing quantities as expectations. We see the familiar log likelihood term. Given the fact that the Fisher matrix is the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood, we should be itching to derive this expression twice to get a Hessian out of it. Let’s first obtain the gradient, then get its Jacobian to derive a Hessian. This derivation process was heavily referenced from Agustinus Kristiadi’s blog. Let’s do this one more time to get the Hessian. This conclusion tells us that the curvature of KL divergence is defined by Fisher’s matrix. In hindsight, this is not such a surprising result given that the KL divergence literally had a term for expected log likelihood. Applying the Leibniz rule twice to move the derivative into the integral, we quickly end up with Fisher’s matrix. At this point, you might be wondering about the implications of this conclusion. It’s great that KL divergence and the Fisher matrix are closely related via the Hessian, but what implication does it have for the gradient descent algorithm in distribution space?

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Of course, we could think of an alternate implementation of this algorithm that makes use of the  matrix instead of , but that would be a slightly different recommendation system that uses past user’s movie ratings as information to predict whether or not the particular individual would like a given movie.

In today’s post, we dealt primarily with singular value decomposition and its application in the context of recommendation systems. Although the system we built in this post is extremely simple, especially in comparison to the complex models that companies use in real-life situations, nonetheless our exploration of SVD is valuable in that we started from the bare basics to build our own model. What is even more fascinating is that many recommendation systems involve singular value decomposition in one way or another, meaning that our exploration is not detached from the context of reality.

Let’s define this transformation as , and the matrix corresponding to the decoding . In other words, PCA makes a number of assumptions to simplify this problem. The most important assumption is that each column of  is orthogonal to each other. As we will see later in an alternate derivation with statistics, this has to do with the notion of covariance. Another restriction is that the columns of  must have a Euclidean norm of one.

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Of course, this code is limited in that is only applicable to a very specific situation, namely the task of deriving the posterior given a normal prior and a normal likelihood with known variance. Nevertheless, we can glean so much insight from this fascinating function. Let’s quickly test the  function by making it sample five estimations of the mean parameter. As expected, the sampler starts from the 0, which is the default argument  and took a jump at the second sample. After that jump, the sampler rejects the next three values sampled from the proposal distribution, as it stayed dormant at the value 0.17414333. However, with more iterations, we would expect the function to make more jumps, gradually painting a picture of what the posterior should look like. In fact, we can create what is called the trace plot to see which values were sampled by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Trace plots are important because they tell us whether or not our model is well-calibrated, i.e. a sufficient amount of state changes occur.  The trace plot contains the trace of 15000 accepted values sampled from the proposal distribution. We see that there are some fluctuations, indicating that state transitions occurred, but also that there seems to be values that the sampler preferred over others. Eyeballing the trace plot, the “comfort zone” seems to be slightly above 0, as we expect.

Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"The indexing is key here: for each column, \([i + 1, i + 7)\)th rows were assigned the probability of \(1/6\). Let’s say that a player is in the \(i\)th cell.

However, this algorithm has to be modified for  bigger or equal to 95. For example if , there are only three probabilities: \(P(X = 98)\), \(P(X = 99)\), and \(P(X = 100)\), each of values \(1/6\), \(1/6\), and \(2/3\) respectively. The  statements are additional corrective mechanisms to account for this irregularity. So now we’re done with the stochastic matrix! … or not quite. Things get a bit more complicated once we throw the chutes and ladders into the mix. To achieve this, we first build a dictionary containing information on the jump from one cell to another. In this dictionary, the keys correspond to the original position; the values, the index of the cell after the jump, either through a chute or a ladder. For example,  represents the first ladder on the game board, which moves the player from the first cell to the thirty eighth cell.

Word2vec from Scratch,"The first step, as is the approach taken in many NLP tasks, is to tokenize the text, i.e. splitting the text up into smaller units like words, getting rid of punctuations, and so on.

Another useful operation is to create a map between tokens and indices, and vice versa. In a sense, we are creating a lookup table that allows us to easily convert from words to indices, and indices to words. This will be particularly useful later on when we perform operations such as one-hot encoding. Let’s check if the word-to-index and index-to-word maps have successfully been created.

Now that we have tokenized the text and created lookup tables, we can now proceed to generating the actual training data, which are going to take the form of matrices. Since tokens are still in the form of strings, we need to encode them numerically using one-hot vectorization. We also need to generate a bundle of input and target values, as this is a supervised learning technique. This then begs the question of what the input and target values are going to look like.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"The other day, I came across an interesting article by Chris Henson on the relationship between the Riemann Zeta function and prime numbers. After encountering a similar post on the math Stack Exchange, I thought I’d write an article on the same topic as well, perhaps as sort of a prologue to a previous article posted on this blog, Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler. The code introduced in this blog are adaptations of those written by Chris Henson, so all credits go to the original author. With that said, let’s dive right into it. The Riemann Zeta function is perhaps one of the most deeply studied functions in all of modern mathematics. It is sometimes also referred to as the Euler-Riemann Zeta function, but I will not adhere to this convention not only because it is needlessly long and cumbersome, but also because Euler already has so many constants and functions and theorems bearing his name. Anyhow, the Riemann Zeta function looks as follows: While there are so many layers to explore with this function, one relatively simple and interesting route is to factorize this function. We performed this factorization in the previous post while introducing Euler’s infinite product representation of the Zeta function. Let’s go through this step again, as it is pivotal for our segue into the topic of prime numbers and probability.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Calculating \(AA^T\), we get which is symmetric as we expect. We can calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix by finding the roots of the following characteristic polynomial: Since \(\Sigma\) in SVD is the diagonal matrix that contains the square roots of the eigenvalues of \(AA^T\), we can conclude that where \(\sigma_n\) denotes the value of the \(n\)th diagonal entry in \(\Sigma\). Therefore, given the dimensionality of \(A\), we can conclude that Next, we find the eigenvalues of \(AA^T\). This process can be performed by identifying the null space of the matrix \(AA^T - \lambda I\). For instance, given \(\lambda_1 = 25\), Given the orientation of this matrix, we see that By doing the same for \(\lambda_2 = 9\), we can construct the matrix \(U\): Repeating the procedure for \(A^{T}A\) to obtain the factor \(V\), we can complete the singular value decomposition on A: The key to dimensionality reduction is that the first few columns of \(U\), its corresponding eigenvalues in \(\Sigma\), and the corresponding first few rows of \(V^T\) contain the most amount of information on matrix \(A\). As we  go down the diagonal entries of \(\Sigma\), we see that the eigenvalues get smaller. The rule of thumb is that the smaller the eigenvalue, the lesser contribution it has on expressing data on \(A\). In other words, we can obtain an approximation of \(A\) by extracting the first few columns and rows of each factor. For example, This may seem like a very clumsy way of approximating \(A\).",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"For the purposes of this post, we will assume that each coin flip is independent of others, i.e. the coin flips are independent and identically distributed. Let’s start by coming up with a model representation of the likelihood function, which we might recall is the probability of having a parameter value of \(\theta\) given some data \(D\). It is not difficult to see that the best distribution for the likelihood function given the setup of the problem is the binary distribution since each coin flip is a Bernoulli trial. Let \(X\) denote a random variable that represents the number of tails in \(n\) coin flips. For convenience purposes, we define 1 to be heads and 0 to be tails. Then, the conditional probability of obtaining \(k\) heads given a fairness parameter \(\theta\) can be expressed as We can perform a quick sanity check on this formula by observing that, when \(\theta = 0\), the probability of observing \(k\) heads diminishes to 0, unless \(k = 0\), in which case the probability becomes 1. This behavior is expected since \(\theta = 0\) represents a perfectly biased coin that always shows tails. By symmetry, the same logic applies to a hypothetical coin that always shows heads, and represents a fairness parameter of 1. Now that we have derived a likelihood function, we move onto the next component necessary for Bayesian analysis: the prior.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Neural networks are powerful models that can be used to identify complex hidden patterns in data. There are many types of neural networks, two of which we have seen already on this blog: the vanilla, feed-forward neural network and convolutional neural networks, often abbreviated as convnets. Today, we will add a third kind to this exciting mix: recurrent neural networks, or RNNs. Let’s take a brief conceptual look at how recurrent neural networks work, then implement a toy RNN to see how it compares to other models on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. I heavily borrowed my examples from Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet and the tutorial on text classification available from the official TensorFlow documentation. Recurrent neural networks, as the name implies, refer to neural network models that contain some sort of internal looping structure that simulates a flow of information. A good way to conceptualize this loop is to think of something like  loops, where a certain operation is performed repeatedly for a specified number of cycles. Given these pieces of information, we might ask ourselves two questions. Firstly, what does this looping operation involve? Secondly, what is the purpose of having this loop in the first place? Let’s try to answer both questions in the following subsections. One of the most salient features of a recurrent neural network is that it is capable of emulating some primitive form of memory. Why might we want to do this? Well, take the example of reading a text.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"Also, for easier plotting, we will return the  domain range object alongside the result of our simulation. The function is just a two-liner—we were able to reduce the number of lines thanks to list comprehension. Now, let’s see if this code works as expected. Here, our experiment consisted of sampling two numbers, starting from range , all the way up to range , with 1000 simulations for each range. Let’s plot the results to get a better idea of what was going on.  First, notice that when , the probability that two sampled numbers are coprime is 1. This is unsurprising, since sampling from range  simply means that both the sampled numbers were 2—and of course, 2 and 2 are coprimes. However, as the range expands all the way up to 200, we see that the probability of two numbers being coprime drops precipitously, roughly converging to the value of  as we expect. Indeed, the dots seem to cluster around the gold line, which represents the value of the Zeta function evaluated at 2. But does this result generalize to cases where we sample more than just two numbers? In other words, if we sample  numbers, would the probability that the numbers be coprime approach ? Let’s find out. Given a range of  values, the  function returns a plot for each , which is effectively  in our mathematical notation. We see that, for the three values of  that were tested—2, 3, and 4—the Zeta function seems to approximate the probability of relative primeness pretty well.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So What are Autoencoders?,"Of course, some information is inevitably going to be lost—after all, how can five numbers describe the entirety of an image? However, what’s important and fascinating about autoencoders is that, with appropriate training and configuration, they manage to find ways to best compress input data into latent vectors that can be decoded to regenerate a close approximation of the input data. For the purposes of this demonstration, let’s configure the latent dimension of the encoder to be 128 dimensions—in other words, each 28-by-28, single-channel image will be encoded into vectors living in 128 dimensional space. It’s time to build the autoencoder model. In summary, an autoencoder is composed of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder transfers input data into the latent dimension, and the decoder performs the exact reverse: it takes vectors in the latent space and rearranges it to bring it back into its original dimension, which is, in this case, a 28-by-28, single-channel image. The followign code snippet implements this logic using the  functional API. Let’s declare the encoder and autoencoder model by invoking the  function with the specified image shape and the dimensionality of the latent space. Just to get a sense of what operations are taking place dimensionality-wise, here is a look at the output shapes of the autoencoder model. Notice that the input is of shape , and that the final output is also of the same shape , as expected. Here’s the image of the model for the fancy bells and whistles.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Linear Regression, in Two Ways","Concretely, since the transpose is an alternate representation of the dot product. We can further specify this equation by using the fact that \(\hat{y}\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of \(A\). In other words, where \(\hat{x}\) is the solution to the system of equations represented by \(Ax = \hat{y}\). Let’s further unpackage (1) using matrix multiplication. Therefore, We finally have a formula for \(\hat{x}\): Let’s remind ourselves of what \(\hat{x}\) is and where we were trying to get at with projection in the context of regression. We started off by plotting three data points, which we observed did not form a straight line. Therefore, we set out to identify the line of best fit by expressing the system of equations in matrix form, \(Ax = y\), where \(x = (a, b)^{T}\). But because this system does not have a solution, we ended up modifying the problem to \(Ax = \hat{y}\), since this is as close as we can get to solving an otherwise unsolvable system. So that’s where we are with equation (2): a formula for \(\hat{x}\), which contains the parameters that define our line of best fit. Linear regression is now complete. It’s time to put our equation to the test by applying it to our toy data set. Let’s apply (2) in the context of our toy example with three data points to perform a quick sanity check.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"But before we move into code, there is something that should be corrected before we move on. In (6), we derived an experssion for the jump condition. The jump condition is not wrong per se, yet a slight modification has to be made to fully capture the gist of Metrapolis-Hastings. The precise jump condition for the sampler goes as follows: where This simply means that we accept the prorposed pararmeter if the quantity calculated in (7) is larger than a random number between 0 and 1 sampled from a uniform distribution. This is why MCMC models involve a form of random walk—while leaving room for somewhat unlikely parameters to be selected, the model samples relatively more from regions of high posterior probability. Now that we have some understanding of how Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, let’s implement the MCMC sampler in Python. As per convention, listed below are the dependencies required for this demonstration. Let’s start by generating some toy data for our analysis. It’s always a good idea to plot the data to get a sense of its shape.  The data looks roughly normal. This is because we created the toy data using the  function, which generates random numbers from a normal distribution centered around 0.

How lucky was I on my shift?,"For one, we operated under a rather shaky definition of a trial by arbitrarily segmenting eight hours into ten-minute blocks. If we modify this definition, say, by saying that a single minute comprises an experiment, hence a total of 480 trials, we get a different values for \(n\) and \(p\), which would clearly impact our calculation of \(P(X = 5)\). In fact, some weird things happen if we block time into large units, such as an hour—notice how the value of \(p\) becomes \(12/8 = 1.5\), which is a probabilistic impossibility as \(p\) should always take values between \([0, 1]\). Another issue with this model is that a Bernoulli trial does not allow for simultaneous successes. Say, for instance, that within one ten-minute block, we got two calls. However, because the result of a Bernoulli trial is binary, i.e. either a success or a failure, it cannot contain more than one success in unit time. Therefore, binary distribution cannot encode higher dimensions of information, such as two or three simultaneous successes in one trial. These set of complications motivate a new way of modeling phone calls. In the next section, we look at an alternate approach to the problem: the Poisson distribution. Here is some food for thought: what if we divide up unit time into infinitesimally small segments instead of the original ten, such that \(n = \infty\)? This idea is precisely the motivation behind the Poisson distribution.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
How lucky was I on my shift?,"At the Yongsan Provost Marshall Office, I receive a wide variety of calls during my shift. Some of them are part of routine communications, such as gate checks or facility operation checks. Others are more spontaneous; fire alarm reports come in from time to time, along with calls from the Korean National Police about intoxicated soldiers who get involved in mutual assault or misdemeanors of the likes. Once, I got a call from the American Red Cross about a suicidal attempt of a soldier off post. All combined, I typically find myself answering about ten to fifteen calls per shift. But yesterday was a special day, a good one indeed, because I received only five calls in total. This not only meant that USAG-Yongsan was safe and sound, but also that I had a relatively light workload. On other days when lawlessness prevails over order, the PMO quickly descends into chaos—patrols get dispatched, the desk sergeant files mountains of paperwork, and I find myself responding to countless phone calls while relaying relevant information to senior officials, first sergeants, and the Korean National Police. So yesterday got me thinking: what is the probability that I get only five calls within a time frame of eight hours, given some estimate of the average number of calls received by the PMO, say 12?

Likelihood and Probability,"The assumption of independence allows us to use multiplication to calculate the likelihood in this manner. Applied in the context of normal distributions with \(n\) observations, the likelihood function can therefore be calculated as follows: But finding the maximum of this function can quickly turn into a nightmare. Recall that we are dealing with distributions here, whose PDFs are not always the simplest and the most elegant-looking. If we multiply \(n\) terms of the normal PDF, for instance, we would end up with a giant exponential term. To prevent this fiasco, we can introduce a simple transformation: logarithms. Log is a monotonically increasing function, which is why maximizing some function \(f\) is equivalent to maximizing the log of that function, \(\log(f)\). Moreover, the log transformation expedites calculation since logarithms restructure multiplication as sums. With that in mind, we can construct a log equation for MLE from (3) as shown below. Because we are dealing with Euler’s number, \(e\), the natural log is our preferred base. Using the property in (3), we can simplify the equation above: To find the maximum of this function, we can use a bit of calculus. Specifically, our goal is to find a parameter that which makes the first derivative of the log likelihood function to equal 0. To find the optimal mean parameter \(\mu\), we derive the log likelihood function with respect to \(\mu\) while considering all other variables as constants.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Let’s take a look at the posterior distribution for each bandit. We can easily plot them using , as shown below. Notice that I have also included the uniform prior for reference purposes.  The result is as we would expect: the bandit with the highest success parameter of 0.7 seems to have been pulled on the most, which explains why its variance is the smallest out of the bunch. Moreover, the mean of that particular posterior is also close to 0.7, its true value. Notice that the rest of the posteriors also somewhat have this trend, although more uncertainty is reflected into the shape of the distributions via the spread. It is interesting to see how we can go from a uniform prior, or , to almost normal-shaped distributions as we see above. To corroborate our intuition that the best bandit was indeed the most pulled, let’s quickly see the proportion of the pulls through a pie chart.  As you can see, there seems to be a positive correlation between the success parameter and the number of pulls. This is certainly good, since we want the gambler to pull on the best bandit the majority of times while avoiding the worse ones as much as possible. This certainly seems to be the case, given that the bandit with the worse parameter—0.1—was pulled the least. Last but not least, let’s revisit the cumulative regret graph introduced earlier.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"We don’t go into much detail about the derivation of the constant term; the bottom line is that we want the integral of the probability distribution function over the relevant domain to converge to 1. If we put the pieces of the puzzle back together, we finally have the probability distribution of the multivariate Gaussian distribution: To develop a better intuition for the multivariate Gaussian, let’s take a look at a case of a simple 2-dimensional Gaussian random vector with a diagonal covariance matrix. This example was borrowed from this source. Using the formula for the multivariate Gaussian we derived in (11), we can construct the probability distribution function given \(X\), \(\mu\), and \(\Sigma\). Note that computing \(\Sigma^{-1}\), the inverse of the covariance matrix, can be accomplished simply by taking the reciprocal of its diagonal entries since \(\Sigma\) was assumed to be a diagonal matrix. Continuing, In other words, the probability distribution of seeing a random vector \(\begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \end{pmatrix}^T\) given \(x_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)\) and \(x_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)\) is equal to the product of the two univariate Gaussians. This result is what we would expect given that \(\text{Cov}(x_1, x_2) = 0\). For instance, if \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are independent, i.e. observing a value of \(x_1\) does not inform us of anything about \(x_2\) and vice versa, it would make sense that the possibility of observing a random vector \(x\) with entries \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) is merely the product of the independent probabilities of each observing \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
First Neural Network with Keras,"Note that the hidden layer uses the  function as its activation function. The dropout layers ensure that our model does not overfit to the data. The last output layer has 10 neurons, each corresponding to digits from 0 to 9. The activation fuction of this last layer is the softmax function, which allows us to interpret the final results as a categorical distribution. Let’s double check that the layers have been formed correctly as per our intended design. Everything looks good, which means we are now ready to compile and train our model. Before we do that, however, it is always a good idea to use the  module to ensure that gradient descent stops when no substantial weight adjustments are being made to our model. In other words, when the model successfully finds the local minimum (or preferably the global minimum), the  will kick in and stop gradient descent from proceeding with further epochs.

Introduction to tf-idf,"As a final step, we normalize the result to ensure that longer documents do not overshadow shorter ones. Normalizing is pretty simple, so we’ll assume that we have a function  that does the job for now. Before we test the code, we obviously need to implement . This can simply done by obtaining the sum of the L2 norm of each vector, then dividing each element by that constant. Here is an easy contrived example we can do in our heads: And now we’re done! If let’s print the tf-idf vectors for each of the four documents in the dummy example. It seems about right, as all the vectors appear normalized and are of the desired dimensions.

Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"A corollary of this simple analysis is that we can now express the probability that a given random number will be a prime number as follows, using (6): In other words, the reciprocal of the Zeta function tells us the probability that a randomly chosen number will be a prime! The more interesting part of the story is that, we can now extend this single-number example to the case of multiple numbers. The only difference is that, instead of considering whether a single number is prime or not, we will consider the notion of coprimeness, or relative primeness. Imagine we randomly sample  numbers, ranging from  all the way up to . What is the probability that these  numbers are all coprime to each other, i.e. the greatest common divisor for these numbers is 1? With some rumination, it isn’t difficult to convince ourselves that this probability can be expressed as Let’s think for a second why this is the case. The probability that some prime number  divides all  through  is going to be , as dividing each number can be considered an independent event. Therefore, the probability that some prime number  does not divide all numbers—i.e. it may divide none or some, but definitely not all—can be expressed as the complement of , or equivalently, .

PyTorch RNN from Scratch,"GRU is probably not fair game for our simple RNN, but let’s see how well it does. Let’s declare the model and an optimizer to go with it. Notice that we are using a two-layer GRU, which is already one more than our current RNN implementation. The training appeared somewhat more stable at first, but we do see a weird jump near the end of the second epoch. This is partially because I didn’t use gradient clipping for this GRU model, and we might see better results with clipping applied. Let’s see the accuracy of this model. And we get an accuracy of around 80 percent for this model. This is better than our simple RNN model, which is somewhat expected given that it had one additional layer and was using a more complicated RNN cell model.

A PyTorch Primer,"Let’s remind ourselves of Kera’s basic sequential model API: Now let’s compare this method with PyTorch’s way of declaring sequential models: This model declaration is in fact exactly identical to the simple model we have declared above. You can easily see how similar this code snippet is to the Keras example. The only difference is that the activation function is declared independently of the layer itself in PyTorch, whereas Keras combines them into one via  argument. Of course, you don’t have to specify this argument, and we can import the ReLU function from TensorFlow to make it explicit like the PyTorch example. The point, however, is that the sequential model API for both libraries are pretty similar. Another way to build models is by subclassing .

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"We can now plug this function into our crude Monte Carlo  and hope that the algorithm will provide us with an accurate estimation of this expression. So we have a number! But how do we know if this is an accurate estimation? Unlike in previous problems, where we already knew the true value of our estimate and measured the error of our simulation by comparing it with the known value, the true value of the integral expression is unknown in this problem because we have not evaluated the integral by hand. One way we can go about this dilemma is to calculate variance. Intuitively, if our estimate is indeed accurate, running the same Monte Carlo simulation would yield a value very similar to that of the previous. Conversely, if our estimate is inaccurate, the variance would be large, suggesting that our estimate has not converged to a value yet. Indeed, this is exactly what we attempted to visualize with the error plot above in our \(\pi\) estimation example. However, in most cases where Monte Carlo methods are used, we have no idea about the true value of the quantity we wish to estimate, like the complicated integral problem in this case, which is why we cannot simply calculate error by substracting our estimate from the true value.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Then, we have If we left multiply both sides by \(A\), we get By the definition of an eigenvector, it is not difficult to see that \(AA^{T}\) has an eigenvector \(Ax\) whose corresponding eigenvalue is \(\lambda\).

Now that we have a mathematical understanding of how singular value decomposition, let’s see how we can apply SVD to build a simple recommendation algorithm. This section will continue as follows. First, we examine SVD as a technique of data compression and dimensionality reduction. Next, we generate some toy data of movie reviews and apply SVD to see how we can build a simple function that gives movie recommendations to users given their movie ratings history. Let’s jump right in. Why is singular value decomposition so important? Sure, it should now be fairly clear that SVD is a decomposition technique that can be applied to any matrix, whether square or not, which in and of itself makes it a very powerful tool in the statistician’s arsenal. But the true beauty of singular value decomposition comes from the fact that we can perform data compression by extracting meaningful information from the given data. This process is otherwise known as dimensionality reduction, and it is one of the most common applications of singular value decomposition. Let’s see what this means with an example.

Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This network pretty much follows the standard vanilla convolutional neural network model, which typically involves stacking convolution, batch normalization, and pooling layers on top of each other.

The  argument ensures that the the feature maps are not downsized too quickly due to repeated applications of convolution and pooling. The  layer simply normalizes the tensor returned from the previous layer. There are ongoing research as to what effect batch normalization has on neural networks, but the general consensus is that it helps the model learn more quickly and efficiently.

Natural Gradient and Fisher,"This is the motivation behind the notion of a natural gradient. Now you might be wondering how all this has anything to do with the Fisher matrix, which we looked at in the previous post. Well, it turns out there are some deep, interesting questions to be posed and connections to be uncovered. If we’re going to search around the distribution space, one natural question to consider is what distance metric we will use for our search. In case of batch gradient descent, we used Euclidean distance. This made sense since we were simply measuring the distance between two parameters, which are effectively scalars or vector quantities. If we want to search the distribution space, on the other hand, we would have to measure the distance between two probability distributions, one that is defined by the previous parameter and the other defined by the newly found parameter after natural gradient descent. Well, we know one great candidate for this task right off the bat, and that is KL divergence. Recall that KL divergence is a way of quantifying the pseudo-distance between two probability distributions. The formula for KL divergence is shown below. And while we’re at it, let’s throw cross entropy and entropy into the picture as well, both for review and clarity’s sake: For a short, simple review of these concepts, refer to this previous article, or Aurelien Geron’s video on YouTube.

Let’s begin the derivation: let \(A\) be the matrix of interest, \(S\) a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of \(A\), and \(\Lambda\), a matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding eigenvalues of \(S\). Let’s consider the result of multiplying \(A\) and \(S\). If we view multiplication as a repetition of matrix-times-vector operations, we yield the following result.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","The Basel problem is a specific case of the Riemann zeta function, whose general form can be written as follows. A small digression: when \(s = 3\), the zeta function converges to a value known as Apéry’s constant, eponymously named after the French mathematician who proved its irrationality in the late 20th century. Beyond the field of analytics and pure math, the zeta function is widely applied in fields such as physics and statistics. Perhaps we will explore these topics in the future. So back to the zeta function. In the later segment of his life, Euler found a way to express the zeta function as, you guessed it, an infinite product. This time, however, Euler did not rely on Taylor polynomials. Instead, he employed a more general approach to the problem. It is here that we witness Euler’s clever manipulation of equations again. We commence from the zeta function, whose terms are enumerated below. Much like how we multiply the ratio to a geometric sequence to calculate its sum, we adopt a similar approach by multiplying the second term, \(\frac{1}{2^s}\) to the entire expression. This operations yields By subtracting this modified zeta function from the original, we derive the following expression below. Now, we only have what might be considered as the odd terms of the original zeta function. We then essentially repeat the operation we have performed so far, by multiplying the expression by \(\frac{1}{3^s}\) and subtracting the result from the odd-term zeta function.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Markov Chain and Chutes and Ladders,"In a previous post, we briefly explored the notion of Markov chains and their application to Google’s PageRank algorithm. Today, we will attempt to understand the Markov process from a more mathematical standpoint by meshing it together the concept of eigenvectors. This post was inspired and in part adapted from this source. In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a linear transformation is roughly defined as follows: a nonzero vector that is mapped by a given linear transformation onto a vector that is the scalar multiple of itself This definition, while seemingly abstract and cryptic, distills down into a simple equation when written in matrix form: Here, \(A\) denotes the matrix representing a linear transformation; \(x\), the eignevector; \(\lambda\), the scalar value that is multiplied onto the eigenvector. Simply put, an eigenvector \(x\) of a linear transformation is one that is—allow me to use this term in the loosest sense to encompass positive, negative, and even imaginary scalar values—“stretched” by some factor \(\lambda\) when the transformation is applied, i.e. multiplied by the matrix \(A\) which maps the given linear transformation. The easiest example I like to employ to demonstrate this concept is the identity matrix \(I\). For the purpose of demonstration, let \(a\) be an arbritrary vector \((x, y, z)^{T}\) and \(I\) the three-by-three identity matrix. Multiplying \(a\) by \(I\) produces the following result: The result is unsurprising, but it reveals an interesting way of understanding \(I\): identity matrices are a special case of diagonalizable matrices whose eigenvalues are 1.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"The biggest difference between correlation and covariance is that correlation is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas covariance is unbounded. The bottom line is that both correlation and covariance measure the strength of linearity between two variables, with correlation being a normalized version of covariance. At this point in time, one might point out that covariance is not really a multivariate concept since it is defined for only two variables, not three or more. Indeed, the expression \(\text{Cov}(X, Y, Z)\) is mathematically incoherent. However, covariance can be  a multivariate metric since we can express the covariance of any pairs of random variables by constructing what is called the covariance matrix. Simply put, the covariance matrix is a matrix whose elements are the pairwise covariance of two random variables in a random vector. Before we get into the explanation, let’s take a look at the equation for the covariance matrix: where \(\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) and \(\mathbf{E}(X) = \mu \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}\). This is the matrix analogue of the expression which is an alternate definition of variance. It is natural to wonder why we replaced the squared expression with \((X - \mu)(X - \mu)^{T}\) instead of \((X - \mu)^{T}(X - \mu)\) as we did earlier with the term in the exponent. The simplest answer that covariance is expressed as a matrix, not a scalar value. By dimensionality, \((X - \mu)(X - \mu)^{T}\) produces a single scalar value, whereas \((X - \mu)(X - \mu)^{T}\) creates a matrix of rank one.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"You might remember back in the old days when autocomplete was just terrible. The suggestions provided by autocomplete would be useless if not downright stupid—I remember that one day when I intended to type “Gimme a sec,” only to see my message get edited into “Gimme a sex” by the divine touches of autocomplete. On the same day, the feature was turned off on my phone for the betterment of the world. Now, times have changed. Recently, I decided to give autocorrect a chance on my iPhone. Surprisingly, I find myself liking autocomplete more than hating it, especially now that the weather is getting colder by each day: when my frost-numbed finger tips touch on the wrong places of the phone screen to produce words that aren’t really words, iPhone’s autocomplete somehow magically reads my mind to rearrange all that inscrutable alphabet soup into words that make actual, coherent sense. Sometimes, it’s so good at correcting my typos that I intentionnally make careless mistakes on the keyboard just to see how far it can go. One of the obvious reasons behind such drastic improvements in autocomplete functionality is the development of deep neural networks. As we know, neural networks are great at learning hidden patterns as long as we feed it with enough data.

A PyTorch Primer,"One detail to note is that, unlike in the case above where we had to explicitly call  in order to obtain the loss value—which would be of type —we leave the computed loss to remain as a tensor in order to call . We also make sure to reset the gradients per epoch by calling . We can also improve our implementation by making use of the  class that we implemented earlier. This is simple as doing This might be a better way to implement the function for reasons of simplicity and readability. Although ing works, it’s more arguably cleaner to write a ReLU this way. Also, this is a dummy example, and we can imagine a lot of situations where we might want to write custom functions to carry out specific tasks. Much like TensorFlow, PyTorch offers to ways of declaring models: function-based and class-based methods. Although I have just started getting into PyTorch, my impression is that the later is more preferred by PyTorch developers, whereas this is not necessarily the case with Keras or . Of course, this is a matter of preference and development setting, so perhaps such first impression generalizations do not carry much weight. Nonetheless, in this section, we will take a look at both ways of building models. Let’s start with the function-based method.

A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"First, note that our model accepts input of size . The dimensionality of the output is a little more tricky because of the  option. What concatenate does is that it basically flattens all  number of outputs into a single list. In this case, because we set the option to , we get a flattened list containing , or 6400 elements. The main takeaway is that recurrent neural networks can be used to implement some sort of memory functionality, which is useful when dealing with datasets where there exists some sort of sequential structure. One way to implement memory is by using the output of the previous sequence to define a  variable, which is used to compute the next output as we have done above. Now let’s get down to business with the  API. Implementing a recurrent neural network is not so much different from building a simple feed forward or convolutional neural network: we simply import a RNN-specific layer and arrange these layers to construct a working model. Before we proceed any further, let’s first import all necessary dependencies for this tutorial. As with any tutorial, we need to start by loading and preprocessing data. Luckily, there isn’t going to be much preprocessing involved since we will be using a dataset available from the  library, the IMBD movie reviews dataset. The dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled as either positive or negative.

Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms,"Considering the fact that there are a total of  possibilities, the fact that the algorithm was able to narrow it down to a plausible route that beats the baseline is still very interesting. Genetic algorithms belong to a larger group of algorithms known as randomized algorithms. Prior to learning about genetic algorithms, the word “randomized algorithms” seemed more like a mysterious black box. After all, how can an algorithm find an answer to a problem using pseudo-random number generators, for instance? This post was a great opportunity to think more about this naive question through a concrete example. Moreover, it was also interesting to think about the traveling salesman problem, which is a problem that appears so simple and easy, belying the true level of difficulty under the surface. There are many other ways to approach TSP, and genetic algorithms are just one of the many approaches we can take. It is also not the most effective way, as iterating over generations and generations can often take a lot of time. The contrived semi-circle example, for instance, took somewhere around five to ten minutes to fully run on my 13-inch MacBook Pro. Nonetheless, I think it is an interesting way well worth the time and effort spent on implementation. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this post. Catch you up in the next one!.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"In creating tf vectors for each document, we will be referencing the word-to-index mapping in our corpus. Let’s see what we get for the four documents in our dummy example. Due to floating point arithmetic, the decimals don’t look the most pleasing to the eye, but it’s clear that normalization has been performed as expected. Also note that we get 4 vectors of length 9 each, as expected. Next, it’s time to implement the idf portion of the vectorization process. In order to calculate idf, we first need a total count of each number in the entire document collection. A module that is perfect for this job is , which accepts as input an iterable and outputs a dictionary-like object whose values represent the count of each key. Let’s test in on our dummy dataset to see if we get the count of each tokenized word. This is precisely what we need to calculate idf. Recall the formula for calculating idf As noted earlier, the intuition behind idf was that important keywords probably appear only in specific relevant documents, whereas generic words of comparatively lesser importance appear throughout all documents. We transcribe (4) into code as follows: Now, we have the idf vectors for the nine terms in the dummy dataset. At this point, all there is left to do is to multiply the term frequencies with their corresponding idf scores. This is extremely easy, since we are essentially performing a dot product of the tf and idf vectors for each document.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
My First GAN,"Generative models are fascinating. It is no wonder that GANs, or General Adversarial Networks, are considered by many to be where future lies for deep learning and neural networks. In this post, we will attempt to create a very simple vanilla GAN using TensorFlow. Specifically, our goal will be to train a neural network that is capable of generating compelling images of ships. Although this is a pretty mundane task, it nonetheless sheds lights on the potential that GAN models hold. Let’s jump right into it. Below are the dependencies and settings we will be using throughout this tutorial. Before we start building the GAN model, it is probably a good idea to define some variables that we will be using to configure the parameters of convolutional layers, namely the dimensionality of the images we will be dealing with, as well as the number of color channels and the size of the latent dimension. Similar to variational autoencoders, GANs are composed of two parts: the generator and the discriminator. As Ian Goodfellow described in the paper where he first put out the notion of a GAN, generators are best understood as counterfeiters of currency, whereas the discriminator is the police trying to distinguish the fake from the true. In other words, a GAN is a two-component model that involves an internal tug-of-war between two adversarial parties, each trying their best to accomplish their mission.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
A Simple Autocomplete Model,"However, we want to add some element of randomness of noise in the prediction. Why might we want to do this? Well, an intuitive pitfall we might expect is that the model might end up generating a repetition of some likely sequence of characters. For example, let’s say the model’s estimated distribution deems the sequence “God is dead” to be likely. Then, the output of our model might end up being something like this: …(some input text) God is dead God is dead God is dead… (repetition elided) We don’t want this to happen. Instead, we want to introduce some noise so that the model faces subtle obstructions, thereby making it get more “creative” with its output instead of getting trapped in an infinite loop of some likely sequence. Below is a sample implementation of adding noise to the output using log and exponential transformations to the output vector of our model. The transformation might be expressed as follows: where   denotes a transformation,  denotes a prediction as a vector,  denotes temperature as a measure of randomness, and  is a normalizing constant. Although this might appear complicated, all it’s doing is that it is adding some perturbation or disturbance to the output data so that it is possible for less likely characters to be chosen as the final prediction. Below is a sample implementation of this process in code. Note that due to the algebraic quality of the vector transformation above, randomness is increased for large values of .",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Beta, Bayes, and Multi-armed Bandits","Note that we can always generalize such quantities into moments. Given , the expected value of the Beta random variable can be expressed as Proving this is pretty straightforward if we simply use the law of the unconscious statistician. Using the definition of expectation, we can derive the following: Here, we use the Gamma representation of the Beta function. This conclusion gives an even nicer, more intuitive interpretation of the Bayesian update we saw earlier with the Beta prior and binomial likelihood. Namely, given the new posterior we know that sampling from that new posterior will give us a mean value that somewhat resembles the crude approach we would have taken without the prior expectation. Here, the crude approach is referring to the raw frequentist estimate we would have made had we not taken the Bayesian approach to the problem. It is obvious that the two hyperparameters of the prior are acting as an initial weight of sorts, making sure that when little data is available, the prior overshadows observations, but when ample amount of data is collected and available, eventually yields to those observations to estimate the parameter. Now we can turn our attention back to the multi-armed bandit problem. Now we can build on top of our knowledge of the Beta-Binomial update and refine what the frequentist greedy approach. We will also write out some simple functions to simulate the bandit problem and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian approach.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Newton-Raphson, Secant, and More","In the process, I got a little bit extra and also wrote a function that integrates a function in list index representation format. If we integrate , we end up with , where  is the integration constant. Excluding the integration constant, we get a result that is consistent with the  function. While it’s great that we can calculate derivatives and integrals, one very obvious drawback of this direct approach is that we cannot deal with non-polynomial functions, such as exponentials or logarithms. Moreover, the list index representation is unable to represent polynomials that include terms whose powers are not positive integers. For these reasons, we will need some other methods of calculating derivatives as well. Hence the motivation for approximation methods, outlined in the section below. If you probe the deepest depths of your memory, somewhere you will recall the following equation, which I’m sure all of us saw in some high school calculus class: This equation, commonly known as the definition of a derivative, is also known as the forward divided difference formula of calculating derivatives. There is another variant, known as the backward divided difference formula: (1) and (2) are almost nearly identical, but the difference lies in which term is subtracted from who. In (1), we go an infinitesimal step forward—hence the —and subtract the value at the point of approximation, . In (2), we go backwards, which is why we get .

An Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The trace plot below shows that, although the MCMC model does manage to sample many values, it likes to stay too much in its current state, thus making taking much longer for the sampler to properly estimate the posterior by sampling a wide range of values. The bottom line is that setting the right proposal distribution is important, and that trace plots are a good place to start to check if the proposal distribution is set up properly.  Now, it’s time to look at the answer key and see if our sampler has done well. Let’s plot  sampled by our Metropolis-Hastings sampler with the analytic posterior to see if they roughly match.  Fantastic! Although the estimated posterior is not exactly equal to the analytic posterior, the two are quite similar to each other. We could quantify how similar or different they are by using metrics such as [KL divergence], but for simplicity’s sake, let’s contain the post within the realm of Bayes as we have done so far. This goes to show just how useful and powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo can be: even if a complicated likelihood function in high dimensional space, we would be able to use a similar sampling sequence to estimate the posterior. What’s even more fascinating about Markov Chain Monte Carlo is that, regardless of the value we start off with in the proposal distribution, we will eventually be able to approximate the posterior.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Convex Combinations and MAP,"In a previous post, we briefly explored the notion of maximum a posteriori and how it relates to maximum likelihood estimation. Specifically, we derived a generic formula for MAP and explored how it compares to that for MLE. Today’s post is going to be an interesting sequel to that story: by performing MAP on the univariate Gaussian, we will show how MAP can be interpreted as a convex combination, thus motivating a more intuitive understanding of what MAP actually entails under the hood. Let’s jump right into it. The univariate Gaussian is a good example to work with because it is simple and intuitive yet also complex enough for meaningful analysis. After all, it is one of the most widely used probability distributions and also one that models many natural phenomena. With that justification firmly in mind, let’s take a look at the setup of the MAP of the  mean for the univariate Gaussian. As always, we begin with some dataset of  independent observations. In this case, because we are dealing with the univariate Gaussian, each observations will simply be a scalar instead of a vector. In other words, Let’s assume that the random variable is normally distributed according to some parameter . We will assume that the standard deviation of the random variable is given as . We could have considered standard deviation to be a parameter, but since the goal of this demonstration is to conduct MAP estimation on the mean of the univariate Gaussian, we assume that the standard deviation is known.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"More generally, maximum likelihood estimation can be expressed as: It is not difficult to see why trying to compute this quantity may not be as easy as it seems: because we are dealing with probabilities, which are by definition smaller than 1, their product will quickly diverge to 0, which might cause arithmetic underflow. Therefore, we typically use log likelihoods instead. Maximizing the log likelihood amounts to maximizing the likelihood function since log is a monotonically increasing function. Finding the maximum could be achieved multiple ways, such as through derivation or gradient descent. As the name suggests, maximum a posteriori is an optimization method that seeks to maximize the posterior distribution in a Bayesian context, which we dealt with in this post. Recall the Bayesian analysis commences from a number of components, namely the prior, likelihood, evidence, and posterior. Concretely, The objective of Bayesian inference is to estimate the posterior distribution, whose probability distribution is often intractable, by computing the product of likelihood and the prior. This process could be repeated multiple times as more data flows in, which is how posterior update can be performed. We saw this mechanism in action with the example of a coin flip, given a binomial likelihood function and a beta prior, which are conjugate distribution pairs. Then what does maximizing the posterior mean in the context of MAP? With some thinking, we can convince ourselves that maximizing the posterior distribution amounts to finding the optimal parameters of a distribution that best describe the given data set.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Let’s tie this back to our original discussion of the Central Limit Theorem. CLT states that, even if a distribution of a random variable is not normal, the distribution of the sums of these random variables will approximate a normal distribution. Using this handy property on the  independent and identically distributed Poisson random variables of mean and variance , we can see how the sum of these random variables approximates a Gaussian distribution .

On Expectations and Integrals,"Expectation is a core concept in statistics, and it is no surprise that any student interested in probability and statistics may have seen some expression like this: In the continuous case, the expression is most commonly presented in textbooks as follows: However, this variant might throw you off, which happened to me when I first came across it a few weeks ago: I mean, my calculus is rusty, but it kind of makes sense: the probably density function is, after all, a derivative of the cumulative density function, and so notationally there is some degree of coherency here. But still, this definition of the expected value threw me off quite a bit. What does it mean to integrate over a distribution function instead of a variable? After some research, however, the math gurus at Stack Exchange provided me with an answer. So here is a brief summary of my findings. The integral that we all know of is called the Riemann integral. The confusing integral is in fact a generalization of the Riemann integral, known as the Riemann-Stieltjes integral (don’t ask me how to pronounce the name of the Dutch mathematician). There is an even more general interpretation of integrals called the Lebesgue integral, but we won’t get into that here. First, let’s take a look at the definition.

We will be comparing three different methods: By setting  to be , we can obtain a full list of root updates as the three methods begin their quest for the root of the function. We can then see which method converges the quickest. Let’s see how this little experiment turns out. We first begin by importing some dependencies to plot the history of values. Then, we obtain the history for each of the three approaches and plot them as a scatter plot. The result is shown below.  You might have to squint your eye to see that  (Netwon-Raphson with direct derivatives) and  (Newton-Raphson with center divided difference) almost coincide exactly at the same points. I was honestly somewhat surprised by the result: although we had verified the advantage of using center divided difference over forward or backward divided difference via some simple big-O analysis with trailing error terms, I did not expect the two to coincide with such exactitude. Another interesting observation is that the secant method seems to take slightly longer than the Newton-Raphson method.

Gaussian Process Regression,"This is where I think GPs get really interesting: the key point of GP is to realize that we want to model some smooth function that best fits our data. What does this “smoothness” mean in terms of covariance? The answer is that  values that are close to each other must be highly correlated, whereas those that are far apart would have low covariance. In other words, knowing the value of  tells us a lot about the value of , whereas it tells us very little about the value of . In short, the closer the values, the higher the covariance. So at the end of the day, all there is to GP regression is to construct this covariance matrix using some distance function. In GPs, these covariance matrices are referred to as kernels. Kernels can be understood as some sort of prior that we impose upon the regression problem. The idea of smoothness noted earlier is one such example of a prior. But it is a general prior that makes a lot of sense, since we normally don’t want stepwise or non-differential functions as the result of regression. But there are hundreds and thousands of kernels out there that each suit different purposes. For the sake of simplicity, however, we will only take a look at one such kernel that relates to smoothness: the squared exponential kernel, often referred to as the RBF kernel.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This result aligns with the earlier observation that center divided difference provides very accurate approximations of the first derivative. Note that the advantage of using  is that we can now apply Newton-Raphson to non-polynomial equations that cannot be formulated in list index representation format. For instance, let’s try something like . To verify that this is indeed correct, we can plug  back into . Also, given that , we can use some heuristics to realize that the answer must be only ever so slightly larger than 1.

"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","If we repeat this process once more, a clear pattern emerges: Iterating over this process will eventually allow us to express our target coefficient as a sum of inverse squares multiplied by some constant, in this case \(\pi^2\): But then we already know the value of \(C\) from the modification of the Taylor polynomial for sine we saw earlier, which is \(- \frac{1}{6}\)! Therefore, the Basel problem reduces to the following: Therefore, And there we have the solution to the Basel problem. In hindsight, solving the Basel problem is not rocket science; it is a mere application of the Taylor polynomial, coupled with some modifications and operations to mold the problem into a specific form. However, it takes extreme clairvoyance to see the link between the Basel problem and the Taylor polynomial of the sine function. At this point, it doesn’t even surprise us to know that Euler applied this line of thinking to calculate the value of the sum of higher order inverses. An interesting corollary of Euler’s solution to the Basel problem is the Wallis product, which is a representation of the quantity \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) as an infinite product, as shown below: It seems mathematically unintuitive to say that an irrational number such as \(\pi\) can be expressed as a product of fractions, which is a way of representing rational numbers.

Dissecting LSTMs,"The first component of LSTM is the forget gate. This corresponds to these two set of equations: (1) is nothing more than just the good old forward pass. We concatenate  and , then multiply it with some weights, add a bias, and apply a sigmoid activation. At this point, you might be wondering why we use a sigmoid activation instead of something like ReLU. The reason behind this choice of activation function becomes apparent once we look at (4), which is how LSTM imitates forgetting. For now, we will only focus on the first term in (4). Recall that the output of a sigmoid activation is between 0 and 1. Say the output of applying a sigmoid activation results in some value that is very close to 0. In that case, calculating the Hadamard product will also result in a value of an entry very close to 0. Given the interpretation that , also known as the cell state, is an artificial way of simulating long-term memory, we can see how having zeros is similar to forgetfulness: a zero entry effectively means that the network deemed a particular piece of information as obsolete and decided to forget it in favor of accepting new information. In short, the sigmoid activation and the Hadamard product form the basis of LSTM’s forget gate. By now, it should be apparent why we use sigmoid activations: instead of causing divergence with something like ReLU, we want to deliberately saturate and cause the network to produce some “vanishing” values.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Scikit-learn Pipelines with Titanic,"We opt to drop it instead. Correlation (or somewhat equivalently, covariance) is a metric that we always care about, since ultimately the goal of ML engineering is to use a set of input features to generate a prediction. Given this context, we don’t want to feed our model useless information that lacks value; instead, we only want to feed into the model highly correlated, relevant, and informative features. If certain features in the raw data are deemed useless, we need to either drop it or engage in some sort of feature engineering to produce a new set of more correlated features.  From this preliminary analysis, it seems like there are some very weekly correlated features, namely  and . The week correlation suggests that perhaps we need to engage in some feature engineering to extract more meaningful information out of the dataset. Let’s use the findings from the previous section to engineer some more informative features. One popular approach is to make use of names to derive a  feature. Intuitively, this makes sense: Mr. and Mrs, Cpt. and Dr. might be of interest for our model. Another popular approach is to combine the less important features— and —into something like . Implementing these should fairly be simple, so let’s try it here. Note that in an actual setting, there will be no answer to reference; we will have to rely on our own domain knowledge and more extensive EDA to figure out which features matter, and what new features we will need.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Naive Bayes Model From Scratch,"The accuray score yielded by  is exactly identical to that achieved by our model! Looks like the  model in scikit-learn does exactly what our model does, at least juding from the metric of accuracy. This is surprising, but since we basically followed the Bayesian line of reasoning to buid our model, which is what naive Bayes really is all about, perhaps this is not as astonishing as it seems. In this post, we built the Gaussian naive Bayes model from scratch. In the process, we reviewed key concepts such as Bayesian inference and maximum a posteriori estimation, both of which are key statistical concepts used in many subdomains of machine learning. Hopefully through this tutorial, you gained a better understanding of how Gaussian mathematics and Bayesian thinking can be used in the context of classification. The true power of naive Bayes is not limited to the task of classificaiton, however. In fact, it is used in many fields, most notably natural language processing. Perhaps we might look into the possible applications of naive Bayes in the context of NLP in a future post. But for now, this level of modeling will do. Thanks for reading.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Recall that the conditional probability of our interest was while the pieces of information we were provided were This is where Bayes’ theorem comes in handy. Notice that we have expressed \(P(\text{sick} \mid \text{test +})\) in terms of \(P(\text{test +} \mid \text{sick})\) and \(P(\text{test +} \mid \text{¬sick}) P(\text{¬sick})\). From a statistics point of view, all we have to do now is conduct a random survey of the population to see the percentage of the demographic infected with the flu. Let’s say that 15 percent of the population has been affected with this flu. Plugging in the relevant value yields Using Bayes’ theorem, we are able to conclude that there is roughly a 24 percent chance that the man who tests positive on this examination is affected by the flu. That seems pretty low given the 90 percent accuracy of the test, doesn’t it? This ostensible discrepancy originates from the fact that the test has a substantial false positive of 50 percent, and also that the vast majority of the population is unaffected by the disease. This means that, if the entire population were to conduct this test, there would be more false positives than there would be true positives; hence the distortion in the value of the conditional probability. But what if the man were to take the same test again? Intuition tells us that the more test he takes, the more confident we can be on whether the man is or is not affected by the disease.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Dissecting the Gaussian Distribution,"If there is one thing that the field of statistics wouldn’t be complete without, it’s probably normal distributions, otherwise referred to as “the bell curve.” The normal distribution was discovered and studied extensively by Carl Friedrich Gauss, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution. We have seen Gaussian distributions before in this blog, specifically on this post on likelihood and probability. However, normal distribution was introduced merely as an example back then. Today, we will put the Gaussian distribution on stage under undivided spotlight. Of course, it is impossible to cover everything about this topic, but it is my goal to use the mathematics we know to derive and understand this distribution in greater detail. Also, it’s just helpful to brush up on some multivariable calculus in a while. Let’s start with the simplest case, the univariate Gaussian distribution. The “univariate” part is just a fancier way of saying that we will dealing be dealing with one-dimensional random variables, i.e. the distribution is going to be plotted on a two-dimensional \(xy\) plane. We make this seemingly trivial distinction to distinguish it from the multivariate Gaussian, which can be plotted on three-dimensional space or beyond. We’ll take a look at the multivariate normal distribution in a later section. For now, let’s derive the univariate case. One of the defining properties of data that are said to be normally distributed when the rate at which the frequencies decrement is proportional to its distance from the mean and the frequencies themselves.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
MLE and KL Divergence,"These days, I’ve been spending some time trying to read published research papers on neural networks to gain a more solid understanding of the math behind deep learning. This is a rewarding yet also a very challenging endeavor, mostly because I have not studied enough math to really understand all of what is going on. While reading the groundbreaking research paper Wasserstein GAN by Martin Arjovsky, I came across this phrase: … asymptotically, maximum likelihood estimation amounts to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence… I was particularly interested in the last portion of this sentence, that MLE amounts to minimizing KL divergence. We discussed MLE multiple time on this blog, including this introductory post and a related post on MAP. Neither is KL divergence an entirely unfamiliar topic. However, I had not thought about these two concepts together in one setting. In this post, let’s try to hash out what the quote from the paper means. Let’s start with a very quick review of what MLE and KL divergence each are. After all, it’s been a while since I’ve written the linked posts, and for a fruitful, substantive discussion on this topic, it’s necessary to make sure that we have a solid grasp of what MLE and KL divergence are. MLE is a technique used to find the optimal parameter of a distribution that best describes a set of data.

This is by no means a comprehensive guide, and I could not even tell anyone that I “know” how to use PyTorch. Nonetheless, I’m glad that I was able to gain some exposure to the famed PyTorch module. Also, working with Django has somewhat helped me grasp the idea of classes more easily, which certainly helped me take in class-based concepts in PyTorch more easily. I distinctively remember people saying that PyTorch is more object-oriented compared to TensorFlow, and I might express agreement to that statement after having gone through the extreme basics of PyTorch. In the upcoming articles, I hope to use PyTorch to build more realistic models, preferrably in the domain of NLP, as that seems to be where PyTorch’s comparative advantage stands out the most compared to TensorFlow. Of course, this is not to say that I don’t like TensorFlow anymore, or that PyTorch is not an appropriate module to use in non-NLP contexts: I think each of them are powerful libraries of their own that provide a unique set of functionalities for the user.

Demystifying Entropy (And More),"where  denotes cross entropy; ,entropy, and the last term, KL divergence. Now, let’s try to understand what each of them means. KL divergence has many interpretations. One possible definition of KL divergence is that it measures the average number of extra information content required to represent a message with distribution  instead of . In Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, Kevin P. Murphy describes KL divergence as follows: … the KL divergence is the average number of extra bits needed to encode the data, due to the fact that we used distribution  to encode the data instead of the true distribution . Put differently, KL divergence is the amount of information that is lost when  is used to approximate . Therefore, if  and  are close, KL divergence would be low, whereas the converse would be true when the two distributions are different. We can also extend this notion a bit farther to apply it in the context of Bayesian inference. Recall that Bayesian inference is the process by which we start from some prior distribution and update our beliefs about the distribution with more data input to derive a posterior. In this context, KL divergence can be viewed as the amount of information gained as we move from the prior  to the posterior . Let’s derive the mathematical definition of KL divergence using likelihoods. The derivation process to be introduced is based on this source.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
My First GAN,"This process of putting the pieces together, or adjoining the models, is where I personally find the genius in GAN design. The key takeaway here is that we define  and . As you might imagine, the shape of the input is defined by  we defined earlier. This is the latent space from which we will sample a random noise vector frame to feed into our GAN. Then, the connection between the generator and the discriminator is effectively established by the statement . All this is saying is that GAN’s output is the evaluation of the generator’s fake image by the discriminator. If the generator does well, it will fool the discriminator and thus output 1; 0 vice versa. Let’s take a look at the code implementation of this logic.  Now it’s time to train our model. Let’s first load our dataset. For this, we will be using the  images. The dataset contains low resolutions images, so our output is also going to be very rough, but it is a good starting point nonetheless. One hacky thing we do is concatenating the training and testing data. This is because for a GAN, we don’t need to differentiate the two: on the contrary, the more data we have for training, the better. One might suggest that testing data is necessary for the discriminator, which is a valid point, but the end goal here is to build a high performing generator, not the discriminator, so we will gloss over that point for now.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"The  function loads the CIFAR10 data set from  module, then applies some basic preprocessing to make it more usable for deep learning purposes. The CIFAR10 data set contains 50000 training images, each labeled with 1 of 10 classes, ranging from cats, horses, and trucks to airplanes. This is a classic classification task. The preprocessing occurs on two levels: first, the images are normalized so that its pixels takes values between 0 and 1. The training labels are transformed from an integer class label to a one-hot encoded vector. Let’s load the data to proceed with our analysis. Let’s see what the dimensions of the data are. Because the CIFAR10 data set include color images for its training set, we would expect three channels, each corresponding to red, green, and blue (hence RGB). As expected, it appears that the training data is a tensor of four dimensions, while the target labels are 10 dimensional vectors. To get a better idea of what the CIFAR10 data looks like, here is a basic function that will display the images in the data set for us using . We can see that, although the images are very pixelated, it is somewhat possible to make out what each image is showing.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"Much like we understood \(V\) as a factor of eigendecomposition, \(U\) can be seen as a factor of eigendecomposition, this time on the matrix \(AA^T\). Concretly, Notice the parallel between (2) and (4). It’s not difficult to see that, by symmetry, \(U\) is also going to be an orthogonal matrix containing the eigenvectors of \(AA^T\). The most important difference between \(U\) and \(V\) concerns dimensionality: while \(U\) is a \(m\)-by-\(m\) matrix, V is an \(n\)-by-\(n\). This disparity originates from the fact that \(A\) itself is a rectangular matrix, meaning that the dimensions of \(AA^{T}\) and \(A^{T}A\) are also different. Another point that requires clarification pertains to \(\Sigma\). Earlier, we made a substitution of \(\Sigma^2\) for \(\Lambda\). This tells us that \(\Sigma\) contains the square roots of the eigenvalues of \(A^{T}A\) and \(AA^T\), which, it is important to note, has identical non-zero eigenvalues. If this point brings confusion, I recommend that you peruse over the next subsection on linear algebra. Let’s conclude this section with the formula for singular value decomposition: Hopefully, now it is clear what \(U\), \(\Sigma\), and \(V\) are. Singular value decomposition can intuitively be thought of as a square root version of eigendecomposition, since essentially \(U\) and \(V\) are all derivatives that come from the “square” of a matrix, the two transpose multiples. This intuition also aligns with the fact that \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix containing the square roots of eigenvalues of the transpose products.

PyTorch Tensor Basics,"One of the main takeaways from that experience is that an intuition on dimensionality and tensor operations in general is a huge plus. This gets especially important for things like batching. One very basic thing I learned–admittedly perhaps too belatedly–is the difference between  and  as dimensions. Here is a concrete example. This creates a one-dimensional tensor, which is effectively a list. We can check the dimensions of this tensor by calling , which is very similar to how NumPy works. On the other hand, specifying the size as  results in a two-dimensional tensor. The simple, barely passing answer to the question of why  is two-dimension would be that it has double layered brackets. More exactly speaking, having an additional layer means that it is capable of storing another tensor within it; hence,  is living in a dimension that is one above that of . As mentioned earlier, batch dimension is something that becomes very important later on. Some PyTorch layers, most notably RNNs, even have an argument , which accepts a boolean value. If , PyTorch expects the first dimension of the input to be the batch dimension. If , which is the case by default, PyTorch assumes that the first dimension would be the sequence length dimension. A common operation that is used when dealing with inputs is , or its inverse, . Before explaining what these operations perform, let’s just take a look at an example.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm from Scratch,"First, we enumerate thorugh the data set to calculate all the distances between the given test instance and the data points in the data set.

Let’s see if the code works by testing it on our toy data. The task is to find 5 data points that are closest to the first row of . As expected, the returned list contains the indices of the data points in  that are closest to . We can confirm this by looking at the results of the distance calculation we obtained when testing the  function. Note that the indices are in order; that is, indice 0 corresponds to the closet neighbor—it is in fact that data point itself—and index 2 refers to the farthest neighbor among the  selections. Say we have successfully obtained the list of  nearest neighbors. Now what? Well, it’s time to look up the labels of these neighboring data points to see which class is the most prevalent.

This was a short introductory post on tf-idf vectors. When I first heard about tf-idf vectors from a friend studying computational linguistics, I was intimidated.

The Gibbs Sampler,"Theoretically, it doesn’t matter what these random numbers are—asymptotically speaking, we should still be able to approximate the final distribution, especially if given the fact that we take burn-in into account.

Note that we simply used the initial random values for  through  to sample the first value from a conditional probability distribution. Now, we do the same to sample . Only this time, we can use the result from earlier, namely . We can see how this might help us yield a slightly more convincing result than simply using the random data. We still have to use random values for  through  since we haven’t sampled from their relevant conditional distributions just yet. However, as we go through all the random variables in order, it becomes obvious that we will no longer be using randomly initialized values at one point. Specifically, on the th iteration, we would expect something like this to happen:  can be any number between 1 and , since it is used to represent the th random variable. As we repeat more iterations of sampling, we will eventually end up with a plausible representation of -dimensional vectors, which is what we sought to sample from the intractable distribution!

VGG PyTorch Implementation,"In today’s post, we will be taking a quick look at the VGG model and how to implement one using PyTorch.

I recently realized that there is also a very cool data visualization library called  for observing missing data.  This visualization gives us a more intuitive sense of where the values are missing. In this case, the missing values seem to be distributed somewhat evenly or randomly. However, we can also imagine cases were missing values might have something to do with an inherent attribute in the dataset (e.g. only male participants of a survey might reply “N/A” to some health questionaire involving inquiries on pregnancy). In such cases, using this library to visualize where missing values occur is a good idea, as this is an additional dimension of information that calling  wouldn’t be able to reveal. Now that we have a rough sense of where missing values occur, we need to decide from one of few choices: Indeed, in this case, we will go ahead and drop the  attribute. This choice becomes more obvious when we compute the percentage of null values. This shows us that 77 percent of the rows have missing  attribute values.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"For instance, if the man repeats the exam once and receives a positive report, the conditional probability that he is sick given two consecutive positive test results should be higher than the 24 percent we calculated above. We can see this in practice by reapplying Bayes’ theorem with updated information, as shown below: We see that the value of the conditional probability has indeed increased, lending credence to the idea that the man is sick. Like this, Like this, Bayes’ theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to calculate conditional probabilities and to update them continuously through repeated trials. From a Bayesian perspective, we begin with some expectation, or prior probability, that an event will occur. We then update this prior probability by computing conditional probabilities with new information obtained for each trial, the result of which yields a posterior probability. This posterior probability can then be used as a new prior probability for subsequent analysis. In this light, Bayesian statistics offers a new way to compute new information and update our beliefs about an event in probabilistic terms. Bayesian inference is nothing more than an extension of Bayes’ theorem. The biggest difference between the two is that Bayesian inference mainly deals with probability distributions instead of point probabilities. The case of the potential patient we analyzed above was a simple yet illuminating example, but it was limiting in that we assumed all parameters to be simple constants, such as \(0.9\) for test accuracy and \(0.5\) for false positive frequency.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Gaussian Process Regression,"In other words, the new kernel matrix now becomes This can be seen as a minor correction to the kernel matrix to account for added Gaussian noise.

The Exponential Family,"Normal, binomial, exponential, gamma, beta, poisson… These are just some of the many probability distributions that show up on just about any statistics textbook.

However, reading about the concept of the exponential family of distributions has lent me new insight, and I wish to share that renewed understanding on probability distributions through this post. In this section, we will take a look at what the exponential family of distributions is all about. We will begin by laying out a few mathematical definitions, then proceed to see examples of probability distributions that belong to the exponential family. To cut to the chase, the exponential family simply denotes a  group of probability distributions that satisfy a certain condition, namely that they can be factorized and parametrized into a  specific form, as show below: Here,  is a log noramlizing constant that ensures that the probability distribution integrates to 1. There are other alternative forms that express the same factorization. One such variant that I prefer and find more intuitive uses a simple fractional approach for normalization instead of adding complications to the exponential term.

Word2vec from Scratch,"This process is exactly what embedding is: as we start training this model with the training data generated above, we would expect the row space of this weight matrix to encode meaningful semantic information from the training data. Continuing onwards, here is the second layer that receives as input the embeddings, then uses them to generate a set of outputs. We are almost done. All we now need in the last layer is a softmax layer. When the output is passed into this layer, it is converted into probability vectors whose elements sum up to one. This final output can be considered as context predictions, i.e. which words are likely to be in the window vicinity of the input word. In training—specifically error calculation and backpropagation—we would be comparing this prediction of probability vectors with its true one-hot encoded targets. The error function that we use with softmax is cross entropy, defined as I like to think of this as a dot product of the target vector and the log of the prediction, because that is essentially what the summation is doing. In this alternate formulation, the cross entropy formula can be rewritten as Because  a one-hot encoded vector in this case, all the elements in  whose entry is zero will have no effect on the final outcome.

The confusion matrix shows that our model performs well at determining the death and survival of those passengers who actually died, but performs rather poorly on those who lived. Analyses like these cannot be obtained simply by looking at accuracy, which is why plotting the confusion matrix is always a good idea to get a sense of the model’s performance.

Wonders of Monte Carlo,"Using this formula, let’s plot variance against the number of samples to see what effect increasing the sample size has on variance. The  function accepts a list as an argument and returns the variance seen in the given data set.

This means that, even if we do not know the true value of the integral expression, we can now be confident that the output of the crude Monte Carlo will have converged to an approximation of the true value with sampling size as big as 1000, or even something like 400. This gives us more confidence in saying that the integral expression in (1) is approximates to 0.247. The crude Monte Carlo algorithm we employed here used simple random sampling to generate a series of random numbers to be used for our estimation.

The equality is due to the first property of the delta function outlined in the previous paragraph. The derivation of the rest of the constants can be done in a similar fashion. The trick is to use the fact that the delta function is zero in all domains but .

Building Neural Network From Scratch,"The  function below is an implementation of back propagation that encapsulates equations (14) through (17). There is a subtlety that I did not discuss previously, which has to do with the bias terms. It may appear as if the gradient of the bias term does not match that of the bias term itself. Indeed, that is a valid observation according to equation (16). The way we go about this is that we add up the elements of the matrix according to columns. This is exactly what we do with the  command invoked when computing  and , which represent the gradient of the bias terms. With all the complex math behind, here is the code implementation of back propagation. Finally, our model is ready to be trained! Here is a simple function which we can use to train and test our model. Because each iteration can yield a different accuracy, we repeat the experiment multiple times—or specifically,  times—to obtain the mean accuracy of our model. We also get a standard deviation of the mean accuracy estimate to see whether or not the performance of the model is reliable and consistent. Let’s test our model with the  and  data, with batch size set to 10. The mean accuracy of our model is around 95 percent, which isn’t bad for a simple neural network with just two layers.

A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"In the context of probability, Jensen’s inequality can be summarized as follows. Given a convex function , We won’t get into rigorous proofs here, but it’s not difficult to see why this inequality stands with some basic geometric intuition. Due to its bow-like shape, the expected value of a convex function evaluated across a given interval will always be greater or equal to the function evaluated at the expected value of the random variable.  How is Jensen’s inequality related to the non-negativity of KL divergence? Let’s return back to the definition of KL divergence. For simplicity and to reduce notational burden, we briefly depart from conditional probabilities  and return back to generic distributions  and . Notice that the definition of KL divergence itself is an expected value expression. Also, note that  is a convex function— itself is concave, but the negative sign flips the concavity the other way. With these observations in mind, we can apply Jensen’s inequality to derive the following: Therefore, we have shown that KL divergence is always greater or equal to zero, which was our end goal. There is another version of a proof that I found a lot more intuitive and easier to follow than the previous approach. This derivation was borrowed from this post. We start from the simple observation that a logarithmic function is always smaller than  a linear one.

"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","is a super class from which we can inherit to build anything from full-fledged models to custom blocks or layers to be used in some other larger model. In the initialization function, we also define a number of layers that will be used in forward propagation. You might be wondering why these have to initialized in the initialization function, as opposed to the forward function itself. While I don’t have a complete, technically cogent explanation to that question, intuitively, we can understand a model’s layers as being components of the model itself. After all, the weights of these layers are adjusted with each iteration or epoch. In that sense, we want the layers to be attached to the model instance itself; hence the OOP design of PyTorch’s model class. In this particular instance, we define a number of convolutional layers, a pooling layer, and two fully connected layers used for classification output. The declaration of the layers themselves are not too different from other frameworks, such as TensorFlow. Also, I’ve written out all the named arguments so that it is immediately clear what each argument is configuring. Once we’ve declared all the necessary components in the initialization function, the next steps to actually churn out forward propagation results given some input.

Recommendation Algorithm with SVD,"In a previous post on Markov chains, we examined the clockwork behind eigendecomposition, a technique used to decompose non-degenerate square matrices. Singular value decomposition is similar to eigendecomposition in that it is a technique that can be used to factor matrices into distinct components. In fact, in deriving the SVD formula, we will later inevitably run into eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which should remind us of eigendecomposition. However, SVD is distinct from eigendecomposition in that it can be used to factor not only square matrices, but any matrices, whether square or rectangular, degenerate or non-singular. This wide applicability is what makes singular decomposition such a useful method of processing matrices. Now that we have a general idea of what SVD entails, let’s get down into the details. In this section, we take a look at the mathematical clockwork behind the SVD formula. In doing so, we might run into some concepts of linear algebra that requie us to understand some basic the properties of symmetric matrices. The first section is devoted to explaining the formula using these properties; the second section provides explanations and simple proofs for some of the properties that we reference duirng derivation. We might as well start by presenting the formula for singular value decomposition. Given some \(m\)-by-\(n\) matrix \(A\), singular value decomposition can be performed as follows: There are two important points to be made about formula (1).

We can take a similar approach to calculate the MLE of the other two remaining paramters, namely  and .

For my own personal reference and the curious-minded, here is a link to a resource that contains the full derivation. But the fundamental idea is that we would commence from the log likelihood function and derive our way to the solution. The solutions are presented below: So the full picture is now complete: given the inter-dependence of derived quantities, we seek to optimize them using the Expectation Maximization algorithm.

Thankfully, we’ve already done something very similar in the past when we were building a vanilla neural network from scratch.

Just to make sure that the data has been loaded successfully, let’s take a look at the first 100 characters of the string. ## Preprocessing It’s time to preprocess the text data to make it feedable to our neural network. As introduced in this previous post on recurrent neural networks, the smart way to deal with text preprocessing is typically to use an embedding layer that translates words into vectors. However, text embedding is insuitable for this task since our goal is to build a character-level text generation model. In other words, our model is not going to generate word predictions; instead, it will spit out a character each prediction cycle. Therefore, we will use an alternative technique, namely mapping each character to an integer value. This isn’t as elegant as text embedding or even one-hot encoding but for a character-level analysis, it should work fine.

This is expected given the periodic behavior of the sine function and its intercepts with the \(x\)-axis. Given these zeros, we can then reconstruct the original function \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\) as an infinite product using the fundamental theorem of algebra, or more specifically, Weierstrass factorization.

Specifically, when parameter \(\alpha = 1\) in a Gamma distribution, it is in effect an exponential distribution.

On Expectations and Integrals,"In fact, it is possible to calculate the expectation using the Riemann-Stieltjes integral quite easily, despite the discontinuity! The integral we wish to calculate is the following: Therefore, we should immediately start visualizing splitting up the domain of integration, the real number line, into infinitesimal pieces. Each box will be of height  and width . In the context of the contrived example, this definition makes the calculation extremely easy, since   equals zero in all locations but the jumps where the discontinuities occur. In other words, We can easily extend this idea to calculating things like variance or other higher moments. A more realistic example might be the Dirac delta function. Consider a constant random variable (I know it sounds oxymoronic, but the idea is that the random variable takes only one value and that value only). In this case, we can imagine the probability density function as a literal spike in the sense that the PDF will peak at  and be zero otherwise. The cumulative density function will thus exhibit a discontinuous jump from zero to 1 at . And by the same line of logic, it is easy to see that the expected value of this random variable is , as expected.

For a more detailed explanation of  this mechanism, I strongly recommend that you take a look at this excellent blog post written by Christopher Olah. How do we go about back propagation in the case of our model? First, it is necessary to define a loss function. The most commonly used loss function in the context of classification problems is cross entropy, which we explored in this post previously on this blog. For a brief recap, presented below is the formula for calculating cross entropy given a true distribution  and a predicted distribution : Our goal is to train our neural network so that is output distribution  is as close to  as possible. In the case of binary classification, we might alter equation (9) to the following form: The reformulation as shown in equation (10) is the formula for what is known as binary cross entropy. This is the equation that we will be using in the context of our problem, since the dataset we have only contains two class labels of 0 and 1.

This connection becomes a bit more apparent if we consider the fact that the Riemann integral is calculating the area beneath the curve represented by . In other words, the Riemann-Stieltjes integral can be seen as dealing with a change of variables. You might be wondering why the Riemann-Stieltjes integral is necessary in the first place. After all, the definition of expectation we already know by heart should be enough, shouldn’t it? To answer this question, consider the following  function: This cumulative mass function is obviously discontinuous since it is a step-wise function.

For simplicity purposes, say we have a total of 5 words in the corpus, and that we want to embed these words as three-dimensional vectors. More specifically, here is the first weight layer of the model: A crucial observation to make is that, because the input is a sparse vector containing one-hot encoded vectors, the weight matrix effectively acts as a lookup table that moves one-hot encoded vectors to dense vectors in a different dimension—more precisely, the row space of the weight matrix.

A sneak peek at Bayesian Inference,"Bayes’ theorem is a powerful tool that is the basis of Bayesian statistical analysis. Although our example was just a simple coin toss, the sample principle and mechanism can be extended to countless other situations, which is why Baye’s theorem remains highly relevant to this day, especially in the field of machine learning and statistical analysis. Bayesian statistics presents us with an interesting way of understanding probability. The classical way of understanding probability is the frequentist approach, which purports that a probability for an event is the limit of its frequency in infinite trials. In other words, to say that a coin is fair is to say that, theoretically, performing an infinite number of coin flips would result in 50 percent heads and 50 percent tails. However, the Bayesian approach we explored today presents a drastically different picture. In Bayesian statistics, probability is an embodiment of our subjective beliefs about a parameter, such as the fairness of a coin. By performing trials, infinite or not, we gain more information about the parameter of our interest, which affects the posterior probability. Both interpretations of probability are valid, and they help complement each other to help us gain a broader understanding of what the notion of probability entails.

I decided to go a bit retro and revisit these motifs in today’s post, by introducing Stirling’s approximation of the factorial. There are many variants of Stirling’s approximation, but here we introduce the general form as shown: Let’s begin the derivation by first recalling the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the probability that a certain event occurs a specified number of times within a defined time interval given the rate at which these events occur. The formula looks as follows: One interesting fact about the Poisson distribution is that, when the parameter  is sufficiently large, the Poisson approximates the Gaussian distribution whose mean and variance are both . This happens when the random variable . We can easily simplify (2) since the power of the exponent is zero. Thus, we have By simply rearranging (3), we arrive at Stirling’s approximation of the factorial: This is cool, but we still haven’t really shown why a Poisson can be used to approximate a Gaussian—after all, this premise was the bulk of this demonstration. To see the intuition behind this approximation, it is constructive to consider what happens when we add independent Poisson random variables.

Fourier Series,"For example, The same applies to cosines and sines: where  and  can be any integer.

It’s time to sit back and let the magic unfold when we multiply  to (1) and integrate the entire expression. If we divide both sides of (5) by , you will realize that we have derived an expression for the constant corresponding to the  expansion term: The key takeaway here is this: by exploiting orthogonality, we can knock out every term but one, the very term that we multiplied to the expansion. By the same token, therefore, we can  deduce that we can do the same for the sine terms: The only small caveat is that the case is a bit more specific for . When ,  reduces to a constant of one, which is why we end up with  instead of . In other words, Hence, we end up with This exceptional term has a very intuitive interpretation: it is the average of the function  over the domain of integration.

Convolutional neural networks are great at identifying spatial patterns in data, which is why they also perform reasonably well in natural language processing. Another huge advantage of convents over recurrent networks is that they took a lot lesser time and resources to train.

BLEU from scratch,"This is where BLEU comes to the rescue. The way BLEU works is simple. Given some candidate translation of a sentence and a group of reference sentences, we use a bag-of-word approach to see how many occurences of BOWs co-occur in both the translation and reference sentences. BOW is a simple yet highly effective way of ensuring that the machine translation contains key phrases or words that reference translations also contain. In other words, BLEU compares candidate translations with human-produced, annotated reference translations and compares how many hits there are in the candidate sentence. The more BOW hits there are, the better the translation. Of course, there are many more details that go beyond this. For instance, BLEU is able to account for situations in which meaningless words are repeated throughout the machine translation to simply increase BOW hits. It can also penalize translations that are too short. By combining this BOW precision-based approach with some penalization terms, BLEU provides a robust means of evaluating machine translations. With this high-level overview in mind, let’s start implementing BLEU from scratch. First, let’s begin by defining some simple preprocessing and helper functions that we will be using throughout this tutorial.

For example, the snippet below shows how we can reshape  into a  tensor. One very important detail, however, is that this operation is not in-place. In other words, if we check the size of  again, you will realize that it is still a  tensor, as was originally initialized.

Together, these properties makes MCMC models like Metropolis-Hastings incredible useful for solving intractable problems.  is a library made specifically for Bayesian analysis. Of course, it includes functions that implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. Although building the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from scratch was a worthy challenge, we can’t build models from scratch every time we want to conduct from Bayesian analysis involving an intractable posterior, which is why packages like  always come in handy. With just a few lines of code, we can perform the exact same operation we performed above. In fact, let’s compare our Metropolis-Hastings sampler with the built-in function in the  library.  Pretty similar, wouldn’t you say? Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a powerful method with which we can estimate intractable posterior distributions. It is undoubtedly one of the most important tools that a Bayesian statistician should have under their belt. And even if you are frequentist, I still think MCMC models are worth looking at because it’s cool to see just how easily we can estimate a distribution with little to no knowledge about the mathematics involved in calculating the posterior. It’s also fascinating to see how the marriage of two seemingly unrelated concepts that arose out of different contexts–Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains—can produce such a powerful algorithm.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Step Up with  Variational Autoencoders,"We need the first two parameters to later sample from the latent distribution; , of course, is needed to train the decoder. The decoder network looks similar to the the encoder, except that much of the architecture is in reverse order. Most notably, we use  to undo the convolution done by the encoder. This allows us to effectively scale up the input back to its original dimension, which is what we want to do with a generative model like a VAE. One subtly worth mentioning is the fact that we use a sigmoid activation in the end. This is because we want the pixel values of the output to be between 0 and 1, just as the original input was normalized before it was fed into the encoder network via division by 255. The summary of the decoder network is presented below: Now that we have both the encoder and the decode network fully defined, it’s time to wrap them together into one autoencoder model. This can simply achieved by defining the input as the input of the encoder—the normalized MNIST images—and defining the output as the output of the decoder when fed a latent vector. Concretely, this process might look as follows: Let’s look a the summary of the CVAE. Note that the encoder and the decoder look like individual layers in the grand scheme of the VAE architecture. We have almost everything we need, but there is one crucial step that is missing: compiling the model with an optimizer and a loss function.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Fisher Score and Information,"Fisher’s information is an interesting concept that connects many of the dots that we have explored so far: maximum likelihood estimation, gradient, Jacobian, and the Hessian, to name just a few. When I first came across Fisher’s matrix a few months ago, I lacked the mathematical foundation to fully comprehend what it was. I’m still far from reaching that level of knowledge, but I thought I’d take a jab at it nonetheless. After all, I realized that sitting down to write a blog post about some concept forces me to study more, so it is a positive, self-reinforcing cycle. Let’s begin. Fisher’s score function is deeply related to maximum likelihood estimation. In fact, it’s something that we already know–we just haven’t defined it explicitly as Fisher’s score before. First, we begin with the definition of the likelihood function. Assume some dataset  where each observation is identically and independently distributed according to a true underlying distribution parametrized by . Given this probability density function , we can write the likelihood function as follows: While it is sometimes the convention that the likelihood function be denoted as , we opt for an alternative notation to reserve  for the loss function. To continue, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution’s parameter is given by This is the standard drill we already know.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Riemann Zeta and Prime Numbers,"The idea is that, much like we multiply the ratio to a geometric sequence to calculate its sum, we can multiply terms to the Zeta function to factor out their multiples. For instance, let’s consider the case when we multiply  to the Zeta function. Since the Zeta function itself is an infinite series, we can subtract this result from the original Zeta function. This effectively filters or sieves out all terms whose denominator is a multiple of 2, effectively leaving only the odd terms. Concretely, If we repeat this process for all prime numbers, we will eventually be left with the following: where  denotes the set of all prime numbers. From this, we can come up with the following alternative representation of the Riemann Zeta function: which can also be expressed as Other than the fact that the factorization of the Riemann Zeta function is satisfying in and of itself, the result in (5) also provides us with an interesting probabilistic interpretation on coprimeness. The intuition is pretty simple: given some random natural number , the probability that a prime  will divide  is simply . For example, if we come up with some random number, the probability that 2 will divide that number (that the number is even) is 0.5; the probability that the number will be a multiple of 3 is one-thirds.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"PyTorch, From Data to Modeling","These past few weeks, I’ve been powering through PyTorch notebooks and tutorials, mostly because I enjoyed the PyTorch API so much and found so many of it useful and intuitive. Well, the problem was that I ended up writing something like ten notebooks without ever publishing them on this blog. So really, I’m going over some old notebooks I’ve coded out more than a month ago to finally make it live. That’s enough excuses, let’s get into the basics of PyTorch modeling in this notebook with the CIFAR10 dataset and some basic CNNs. The setup is pretty simple here. We import some modules and functions from PyTorch, as well as  to be able to show some basic training plots. One thing I have noticed is that a lot of people do something like which I personally don’t really get, because you can easily just do If you ask me, I think the latter is more elegant and less cluttered (after all, we don’t have to repeat  twice). I don’t think the two import statements are functionally different, but if I do figure out any differences, I will make sure to update future notebooks. One of the many nice things about PyTorch is the clean, intuitive API. PyTorch comes with good GPU support, and one of the main ways through which this can be done is by creating a  object. Because I am running this notebook on my MacBook Pro, which obviously does not come with Nvidia cuda-enabled graphics cards, the device is set as the CPU.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Maximum A Posteriori Estimation,"In a previous post on likelihood, we explored the concept of maximum likelihood estimation, a technique used to optimize parameters of a distribution. In today’s post, we will take a look at another technique, known as maximum a posteriori estimation, or MAP for short. MLE and MAP are distinct methods, but they are more similar than different. We will explore the similar mathematical underpinnings behind the methods to gain a better understanding of how distributions can be tweaked to best fit some given data. Let’s begin! Before we jump right into comparing MAP and MLE, let’s refresh our memory on how maximum likelihood estimation worked. Recall that likelihood is defined as In other words, the likelihood of some model parameter  given data observations  is equal to the probability of seeing  given . Thus, likelihood and probability are inevitably related concepts that describe the same landscape, only from different angles. The objective of maximum likelihood estimation, then, is to determine the values for a distribution’s parameters such that the likelihood of observing some given data is maximized under that distribution. In the example in the previous post on likelihoods, we showed that MLE for a normal distribution is equivalent to setting  as the sample mean; , sample variance.

Principal Component Analysis,"That is,  is assumed to have a mean of zero, i.e. . If this is not the case, we can easily perform standardization by subtracting the mean from the data. With this setup in mind, let’s finally start the derivation. As said earlier, the goal of PCA is to compress data (and be able to uncompress it) with as little loss of information as possible. We don’t want to compress data in a haphazard fashion; instead, we want the compression scheme to be able to preserve the structure of the data as much as possible in its lower dimensional representation. From this, we can come up with the following equation: In other words, the goal is to find  that which minimizes the difference between the original data and the reconstructed data. Note that finding this optimal  amounts to finding  that most effectively compresses given data. Instead of the L2 norm, let’s consider the squared L2 norm for convenience purposes. Note that minimizing the L2 norm is equal to minimizing the squared L2 norm, so there is no semantic difference. By definition of vector transpose, we can now express the squared L2 norm versions of (3) as follows: where the second to last equality is due to the fact that  and  are both constants that denote the same value. Also,  the argument of the minimum is with respect to , we can omit the first term, which is purely in terms of . It’s time to take derivatives.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
A Brief Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks,"Why dense vectors, then? Can’t we simply use one-hot encoding? That is a valid point, since one-hot encoding is how we mostly deal with categorical variables in a dataset. However, one downside of this approach is that we end up with many sparse vectors. In other words, a lot of resources are wasted because the model now has to process vectors of thousands or millions of dimensions, depending on the vocabulary size. Instead of using sparse vectors to represent each word, we can simply use a denser vector of smaller dimensions to encode our data. Another advantage of this approach is that dense vectors can be used to encode semantic information. You might have heard of the famous example that “king minus male equals queen minus female.” If we were to represent the words king, queen, male, and female as vectors, we can add and subtract vectors to represent and distill meaningful information. This vector-based computation is the key to natural language processing with deep neural networks: by back propagating and adjusting the weights of our embedding layer, our model can eventually be trained to “understand” the meaning of words and their relationship with other words in the form of dense vectors. Enough talking, let’s use the embedding layer to build our neural networks, starting with the simple feed-forward model. The feed-forward neural network model will first have an embedding layer that processes input.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
A PyTorch Primer,"To build our simple model, let’s first write out some variables to use, starting with the configuration of our model and its dimensions. We will also need some input and output tensors to be fed into the model for trainining and optimization. Next, here are the weight matrices we will use. For now, we assume a simple two layered dense feed forward network. Last but not least, let’s define a simple squared error loss function to use during the training step. With this entire setup, we can now hash out what the entire training iteration is going to look like. Wrapped in a loop, we perform one forward pass, then perform backpropagation to adjust the weights. Great! We see that the loss drops as more epochs elapse. While there is no problem with this approach, things can get a lot more unwieldy once we start building out more complicated models. In these cases, we will want to use the auto differentiation functionality we reviewed earlier. Let’s see this in action. Also, let’s make this more PyTorch-y by making use of classes. We will revisit why class-based implementations are important in the next section. Notice we didn’t have to explicitly specify the backpropagation formula with matrix derivatives: by simply calling  properties for each of the weights matrices, we were able to perform gradient descent.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
BLEU from scratch,"Recently, I joined the Language, Information, and Learning at Yale lab, led by Professor Dragomir Radev. Although I’m still in what I would consider to be the incipient stages of ML/DL/NLP studies—meaning it will take time for me to be able to actively participate in an contribute to research and publications—I think it will be a great learning experience from which I can glean valuable insight into what research at Yale looks like. One of the first projects I was introduced to at the lab is domain-independent table summarization. As the name implies, the goal is to train a model such that it can extract some meaningful insight from the table and produce a human-readable summary. Members are the lab seem to be making great progress in this project, and I’m excited to see where it will go. In the meantime, I decided to write a short post on BLEU, a metric that I came across while reading some of the survey papers related to this topic. Let’s dive into it. Before going into code and equations, a high-level overview of what BLEU is might be helpful here. BLEU, which stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is an metric that was introduced to quantitatively evaluate the quality of machine translations. The motivation is clear: as humans, we are able to get an intuitive sense of whether or not a given translation is accurate and of high quality; however, it is difficult to translate this arbitrary linguistic intuition to train NLP models to produce better translations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Convolutional Neural Network with Keras,"This visualization will help us see whether our model is actually learning with each epoch, and whether or not overfitting is occurring at any point in training. The last piece of the puzzle we need is the  function. This function is essentially wraps all the functions we have created previously, first by loading the data, training using that data, building a model, training a model, and calling on the  function to provide a visualization of the model’s learning curve. One minor tweak I used to spice up this function is the , which basically creates more images for the neural network to train on by slightly modifying existing images in the training set. These modifications involve shifting, zooming, and flipping. When we don’t have enough data to train our model on, using the  can be useful. Finally, let’s see how well our model performs!  The result shows that the model has learned decently well, with testing accuracy of approximately 80 percent. This is not the best result, but it is certainly not bad, especially given the fact that the images in the dataset, as we have seen above, are very pixelated and sometimes difficult for even humans to decipher and categorize. That’s all for today. It’s fascinating to see how CNNs are capable of perceiving images and categorizing them after appropriate training. But as we all know, the potential of neural networks far extends beyond image classificaiton.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Basel, Zeta, and some more Euler","It is not difficult to see that iterating through this process will eventually yield Euler’s product identity for the zeta function. The key to understanding this identity is that only prime numbers will appear as a component of the product identity. We can see this by reminding ourselves of the clockwork behind the sieve of Eratosthenes, which is basically how the elimination and factorization works in the derivation of Euler’s identity. Taking this into account, we can deduce that Euler’s identity will take the following form: This expression is Euler’s infinite product representation of the zeta function. These days, I cannot help but fall in love with Euler’s works. His proofs and discoveries are simple and elegant yet also fundamental and deeply profound, revealing hidden relationships between numbers and theories that were unthought of during his time. I tend to avoid questions like “who was the best \(X\) in history” because they most often lead to unproductive discussions that obscure individual achievements amidst meaningless comparisons, but I dare profess here my belief that only a handful of mathematicians can rival Euler in terms of his genius and prolific nature. That is enough Euler for today. I’m pretty sure that this is not going to be the last post on Euler given the sheer amount of work he produced during his lifetime.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Building Neural Network From Scratch,"For example, we can calculate the gradient with respect to the weights of the second affine layer as follows: We won’t get into much mathematical details here, but a useful intuition we can use to derive equation (15) is to pay close attention to the dimensionality of data. Note that the dimension of the gradient as a matrix should equal to that of the layer itself. In other words, , so on and so forth. This is because the purpose of gradient computation is to update the matrix of parameters: to perform an element-by-element update with the gradient, it must necessarily be true that the dimensionality of the gradient equals that of the original matrix. Using this observation, it is possible to navigate through the confusion of transposes and left, right matrix multiplication that one might otherwise encounter if they were to approach it without any intuition or heuristics. To expedite this post, I’ll present the result of the gradient calculations for all parameters below. Note that the indicator function, denoted as , is a simple gate function that calculates the gradient of the ReLU unit: It isn’t difficult to see that the indicator function is simply a derivative of the ReLU function as shown in equation (3). Now, it is time to translate our findings into Python. Because our neural network model is represented as a dictionary, I decided to adopt the same data structure for the gradient. Indeed, that is how we designed the  function above.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Natural Gradient and Fisher,"In the classic context of ML, we want to minimize the KL divergence. In this case, however, we’re simply using KL divergence as a means of measuring distance between two parameters in defined within a distribution space. As nicely stated in layman’s term in this Medium article, … instead of “I’ll follow my current gradient, subject to keeping the parameter vector within epsilon distance of the current vector,” you’d instead say “I’ll follow my current gradient, subject to keeping the distribution my model is predicting within epsilon distance of the distribution it was previously predicting” I see this as an intuitive way of nicely summarizing why we’re using KL divergence in searching the distribution space, as opposed to using Euclidean distance in searching the parameter space. Now it’s time for us to connect the dots between KL divergence and Fisher’s matrix. Before we diving right into computations, let’s think about how or why these two concepts might be related at all. One somewhat obvious link is that both quantities deal with likelihood, or to be more precise, log likelihood. Due to the definition of entropy, KL divergence ends up having a log likelihood term, while Fisher’s matrix is the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood function, or the covariance matrix of Fisher’s score, which is the gradient of the log likelihood. Either way, we know that likelihood is the fundamental bridge connecting the two. Let’s try to compute the KL divergence between  and .",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Introduction to tf-idf,"In this process, we will also convert all documents to lower case as well. Note that  works on each documents, not the entire collection. Let’s try calling the function with the first document in our dummy example. Finally, as part of the preprocessing step, let’s build the corpus. The corpus simply refers to the entire set of words in the dataset. Specifically for our purposes, the corpus will be a dictionary whose keys are the words and values are an ordinal index. Another way to think about the corpus in this context is to consider it as a word-to-index mapping. We will be using the indices to represent each word in the tf, idf, and tf-idf vectors later on in the tutorial. Because we have a very simple example, our corpus only contains 9 words. This also means that our tf-idf vectors for each document will also be a list of length 9. Thus it isn’t difficult to see how tf-idf vectorization can result in extremely high-dimensional matrices, which is why we often apply techniques such as lemmatization or PCA on the final result. Also note that published modules use sparse representations to minimize computational load, as we will later see with scikit-learn. Now it’s time to implement the first step: calculating term frequency. In Python, this simply amounts to looping through each document, creating a tf vector per iteration, and making sure that they are normalized as frequencies at the very end.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
So What are Autoencoders?,"In today’s post, we will take yet another look at an interesting application of a neural network: autoencoders. There are many types of autoencoders, but the one we will be looking at today is the simplest variant, the vanilla autoencoder. Despite its simplicity, however, there is a lot of insight to glean from this example—in fact, it is precisely the simplicity that allows us to better understand how autoencoders work, and potentially extend that understanding to to analyze other flavors of autoencoders, such as variational autoencoder networks which we might see in a future post. Without further ado, let’s get started. We begin by importing all modules and configurations necessary for this tutorial. How do autoencoders work? There are entire books dedicated to this topic, and this post in no way claims to introduce and explore all the fascinating complexities of this model. However, one intuitive way to understand autoencoders is to consider them as, lo and behold, encoders that map complex data points into vectors living in some latent dimension. For example, a 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image might be compressed into a five-dimensional latent vector. The five numbers composing this vector somehow encodes the core information needed to then decode this vector back into the original 28-by-28 pixel RGB channel image.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Word2vec from Scratch,"However, the good news is that we have already derived the equation for backpropagation given a softmax layer with cross entropy loss in this post, where we built a neural network from scratch. The conclusion of the lengthy derivation was ultimately that given our model Since we know the error, we can now backpropagate it throughout the entire network, recalling basic principles of matrix calculus. If backprop is still confusing to you due to all the tranposes going on, one pro-tip is to think in terms of dimensions. After all, the dimension of the gradient must equal to the dimension of the original matrix. With that in mind, let’s implement the backpropagation function. To keep a log of the value of the error throughout the backpropagation process, I decided to make the final return value of  to be the cross entropy loss between the prediction and the target labels. The cross entropy loss function can easily be implemented as follows. Now we’re ready to train and test the model! As we only have a small number of training data—coupled with the fact that the backpropagation algorithm is simple batch gradient descent—let’s just iterate for 50 epochs. While training, we will be caching the value of the cross entropy error function in a  list. We can then plot this result to get a better sense of whether the training worked properly.  And indeed it seems like we did well! We can thus say with some degree of confidence that the embedding layer has been trained as well.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
